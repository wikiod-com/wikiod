Google Spreadsheet or Google Sheets can help you collaborate with teammates! With their built-in chat and many more features, you can edit and complete projects together. With Google Script and functions, mathematical equations can be done within Google Sheets, just like Excel. A cheaper version, and arguably better version, why opt out?
