This section provides an overview of what sass is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within sass, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for sass is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.

**Why SASS?**

 - Inheritance feature
 - We can use conditional statements
 - More functional than traditional `CSS`
 - Efficient and clear way to write `CSS`
