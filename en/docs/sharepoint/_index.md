SharePoint can refer to one or more products from the Microsoft SharePoint family.

 - **SharePoint Foundation**: This was the underlying technology for all SharePoint sites and is no longer available for SharePoint 2016
 - **SharePoint Server**: This is the on-premises version of SharePoint. You can deploy one or more SharePoint servers. It offers additional features over SharePoint Foundation, such as BI capabilities, Enterprise Content Management and more
 - **SharePoint Online**: Cloud-based version of SharePoint. The customer does not need to care about the server infrastructure or scalability. 

**Office 365** is a separate Microsoft offering that includes the SharePoint Online service, although not all plans support all SharePoint features.
