SAML2.0 is an open standard used for transferring authentication and authorization data between Service Providers and Identity Providers.

The most common usage is web based SSO, where SAML is what enabled a user to login to an application with credentials from another system, without having the need to have the two systems directly connect to each other during authentication.
