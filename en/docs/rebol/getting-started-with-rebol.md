## Installation or Setup
> Detailed instructions on getting rebol set up or installed.

The most mature and stable version of Rebol is the official Rebol2, available from the [downloads page][1] for multiple platforms. There are 2 flavors:

1. [**Rebol/View**][2] (version with gui, ~ 0.6 MB)
2. [Rebol/Core][3] (no gui, for servers, ~ 0.3 MB)

The version with gui (Rebol/View) is recommended for newcomers as it is also a super-set of *Rebol/Core*

As the download page states, Rebol requires no installation.  Simply execute the binary you downloaded.
