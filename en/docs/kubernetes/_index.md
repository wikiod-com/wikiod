Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing container-centric infrastructure.

With Kubernetes, you are able to quickly and efficiently respond to customer demand:
- Deploy your applications quickly and predictably.
- Scale your applications on the fly.
- Seamlessly roll out new features.
- Optimize use of your hardware by using only the resources you need.

**Why do I need Kubernetes and what can it do?**

Kubernetes can schedule and run application containers on clusters of physical or virtual machines. However, Kubernetes also allows developers to ‘cut the cord’ to physical and virtual machines, moving from a **host-centric** infrastructure to a **container-centric** infrastructure, which provides the full advantages and benefits inherent to containers. Kubernetes provides the infrastructure to build a truly container-centric development environment.

Kubernetes satisfies a number of common needs of applications running in production, such as:
- co-locating helper processes, facilitating composite applications and preserving the one-application-per-container model,
- mounting storage systems,
- distributing secrets,
- application health checking,
- replicating application instances,
- horizontal auto-scaling,
- naming and discovery,
- load balancing,
- rolling updates,
- resource monitoring,
- log access and ingestion,
- support for introspection and debugging, and
- identity and authorization.

This provides the simplicity of Platform as a Service (PaaS) with the flexibility of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and facilitates portability across infrastructure providers.
