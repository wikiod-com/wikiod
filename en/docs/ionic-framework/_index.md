Ionic is a framework for developing mobile applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ionic applications run as native applications and have a native "look and feel".

Ionic is built on the [AngularJS][1] framework and provides a complete solution to design, build, and package mobile applications. Design is accomplished with a collection of template tools and a [custom icon library][6]. Ionic provides custom [CSS/SASS components][3] as well as [Javascript UI Extensions][5]. Ionic apps can be built, emulated, and packaged with their [Command Line Interface (CLI)][7].

Ionic templates are dynamic and responsive and adapt to their environment to provide a native "look and feel". This adaptation includes layout, style, and icons. Ionic makes independent [platform customization][2] available as well. Because Ionic apps use front end web technology, they can also be viewed in a browser for faster development.

Ionic apps are built on top of [Apache Cordova][9] by default. They have access to all [Cordova Plugins][11] which let you use native functionality, such as push notifications, camera, accelerometer, etc. Cordova apps work on [multiple platforms][10] and devices (phones, tablets, etc.) with very little extra effort. Cordova may be switched out with [other cross-platform technologies][12] such as [trigger.io][13].
