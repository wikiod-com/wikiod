In this topic you'll read about annotations mainly related to Spring MVC. Some of the related annotations are as follows: `@Controller`, `@RequestMapping`, `@RequestParam`, `@RequestBody`, `@ResponseBody`, `@RestController`, `@ModelAttribute`, `@ControllerAdvice`, `@ExceptionHandler`, `@ResponseStatus`.

Of course there're more annotations which are extremly important as well but not belong directly to Spring MVC. Such as: `@Required`, `@Autowired`, `@Resource`, and many more.

## Parameters
| Annotation      | Explanation |
| ------          | ------ |
| `@Controller`   |  With `@Controller` annotation you mark a Java Class as a Class that holds HTTP handlers, in other words, HTTP access points to your application. |
| `@RequestMapping`          | The  `@RequestMapping` annotation is the one that you'll use to mark HTTP handlers (HTTP access points to your application) within your `@Controller` Class|
|`@RequestParam`|Use the `@RequestParam` annotation to bind request parameters to a method parameter in your controller.|


## dispatcher-servlet.xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xmlns:mvc="http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc"
        xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc http://www.springframework.org/schema/mvc/spring-mvc-4.3.xsd
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
            http://www.springframework.org/schema/context http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-4.3.xsd">
        
        
        <mvc:annotation-driven/>
        <context:component-scan base-package="your.base.package.to.scan" />
    </beans>

With these two lines of configuration, you'll enable the usage of MVC annotations.

## @RequestParam
    @Controller
    public class EditPetForm {

        @RequestMapping("/pets")
        public String setupForm(@RequestParam("petId") int petId, ModelMap model) {
            Pet pet = this.clinic.loadPet(petId);
            model.addAttribute("pet", pet);
            return "petForm";
        }
    }

Important to mention, but pretty obvious, is that `@RequestParam` is intended to work when using HTTP GET method only because only with GET you can send a query string with parameters, and `@RequestParam` you can bind parameters in the query string to your controller handler parameters.

## @Controller & @RequestMapping
    @Controller
    @RequestMapping("/appointments")
    public class AppointmentsController {

    //your handlers here, for example:

    @RequestMapping(path = "/new", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public AppointmentForm getNewForm() {
        return new AppointmentForm();
    }

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public String add(@Valid AppointmentForm appointment, BindingResult result) {
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            return "appointments/new";
        }
        appointmentBook.addAppointment(appointment);
        return "redirect:/appointments";
    }
}

With `@Controller` annotation you'll mark a Java Class as a Class that holds several HTTP handlers, in other words, HTTP access points to your application.

The  `@RequestMapping` annotation is the one that you'll use to mark HTTP handlers (HTTP access points to your application) within your @Controller Class
