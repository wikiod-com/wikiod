 - Hive is a data warehouse tool built on top of [Hadoop][1].
 - It provides an SQL-like language to query data.
 - We can run almost all the SQL queries in Hive, the only difference, is that, it runs a map-reduce job at the backend to fetch result from Hadoop Cluster. Because of this Hive sometimes take more time to fetch the result-set.
