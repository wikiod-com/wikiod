## Creating user-defined method objects
User-defined method objects may be created when getting an attribute of a class (perhaps via an instance of that class), if that attribute is a user-defined function object, an unbound user-defined method object, or a class method object. 

    class A(object):
        # func: A user-defined function object
        #
        # Note that func is a function object when it's defined,
        # and an unbound method object when it's retrieved.
        def func(self): 
            pass
    
        # classMethod: A class method
        @classmethod
        def classMethod(self):
            pass
    
    class B(object):
        # unboundMeth: A unbound user-defined method object
        #
        # Parent.func is an unbound user-defined method object here,
        # because it's retrieved.
        unboundMeth = A.func
    
    a = A()
    b = B()
    
    print A.func
    # output: <unbound method A.func>
    print a.func
    # output: <bound method A.func of <__main__.A object at 0x10e9ab910>>
    print B.unboundMeth
    # output: <unbound method A.func>
    print b.unboundMeth
    # output: <unbound method A.func>
    print A.classMethod
    # output: <bound method type.classMethod of <class '__main__.A'>>
    print a.classMethod
    # output: <bound method type.classMethod of <class '__main__.A'>>

When the attribute is a user-defined method object, a new method object is only created if the class from which it is being retrieved is the same as, or a derived class of, the class stored in the original method object; otherwise, the original method object is used as it is.

    # Parent: The class stored in the original method object
    class Parent(object):
        # func: The underlying function of original method object
        def func(self): 
            pass
        func2 = func
    
    # Child: A derived class of Parent
    class Child(Parent):
        func = Parent.func
    
    # AnotherClass: A different class, neither subclasses nor subclassed
    class AnotherClass(object):
        func = Parent.func
        
    print Parent.func is Parent.func                # False, new object created
    print Parent.func2 is Parent.func2              # False, new object created
    print Child.func is Child.func                  # False, new object created
    print AnotherClass.func is AnotherClass.func    # True, original object used



## Turtle example
The following is an example of using an user-defined function to be called multiple(âˆž) times in a script with ease.

    import turtle, time, random #tell python we need 3 different modules
    turtle.speed(0) #set draw speed to the fastest 
    turtle.colormode(255) #special colormode
    turtle.pensize(4) #size of the lines that will be drawn
    def triangle(size): #This is our own function, in the parenthesis is a variable we have defined that will be used in THIS FUNCTION ONLY. This fucntion creates a right triangle
        turtle.forward(size) #to begin this function we go forward, the amount to go forward by is the variable size
        turtle.right(90) #turn right by 90 degree
        turtle.forward(size) #go forward, again with variable
        turtle.right(135) #turn right again
        turtle.forward(size * 1.5) #close the triangle. thanks to the Pythagorean theorem we know that this line must be 1.5 times longer than the other two(if they are equal)
    while(1): #INFINITE LOOP
        turtle.setpos(random.randint(-200, 200), random.randint(-200, 200)) #set the draw point to a random (x,y) position
        turtle.pencolor(random.randint(1, 255), random.randint(1, 255), random.randint(1, 255)) #randomize the RGB color
        triangle(random.randint(5, 55)) #use our function, because it has only one variable we can simply put a value in the parenthesis. The value that will be sent will be random between 5 - 55, end the end it really just changes ow big the triangle is.
        turtle.pencolor(random.randint(1, 255), random.randint(1, 255), random.randint(1, 255)) #randomize color again
