## Dictionary key initializations
Prefer `dict.get` method if you are not sure if the key is present. It allows you to return a default value if key is not found. The traditional method `dict[key]` would raise a `KeyError` exception. 

Rather than doing

    def add_student():
        try:
            students['count'] += 1
        except KeyError:
            students['count'] = 1

Do

    def add_student():
            students['count'] = students.get('count', 0) + 1
    

## Switching variables


## Use truth value testing
Python will implicitly convert any object to a Boolean value for testing, so use it wherever possible.

    # Good examples, using implicit truth testing
    if attr:
        # do something

    if not attr:
        # do something

    # Bad examples, using specific types
    if attr == 1:
        # do something

    if attr == True:
        # do something

    if attr != '':
        # do something

    # If you are looking to specifically check for None, use 'is' or 'is not'
    if attr is None:
        # do something

This generally produces more readable code, and is usually much safer when dealing with unexpected types.

## Test for "__main__" to avoid unexpected code execution
It is good practice to test the calling program's `__name__` variable before executing your code.

    import sys

    def main():
        # Your code starts here

        # Don't forget to provide a return code
        return 0

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sys.exit(main())


Using this pattern ensures that your code is only executed when you expect it to be; for example, when you run your file explicitly:

    python my_program.py


The benefit, however, comes if you decide to `import` your file in another program (for example if you are writing it as part of a library). You can then `import` your file, and the `__main__` trap will ensure that no code is executed unexpectedly:

    # A new program file
    import my_program        # main() is not run

    # But you can run main() explicitly if you really want it to run:
    my_program.main()
