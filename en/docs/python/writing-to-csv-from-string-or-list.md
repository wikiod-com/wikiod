Writing to a .csv file is not unlike writing to a regular file in most regards, and is fairly straightforward. I will, to the best of my ability, cover the easiest, and most efficient approach to the problem. 

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
|open (**"/path/"**, "mode")| Specify the path to your CSV file|
|open (path, **"mode"**)|Specify mode to open file in (read, write, etc.)|
|csv.writer(**file**, delimiter)|Pass opened CSV file here|
|csv.writer(file, **delimiter=' '**)|Specify delimiter character or pattern

    

> `open( path, "wb")`

`"wb"` - Write mode.

The `b` parameter in `"wb"` we have used, is necessary only if you want to open it in binary mode, which is needed only in some operating systems like Windows.

    

>`csv.writer ( csv_file, delimiter=',' )`

Here the delimiter we have used, is `,`, because we want each cell of data in a row, to contain the first name, last name, and age respectively.
Since our list is split along the `,` too, it proves rather convenient for us.

## Basic Write Example
    import csv

    #------ We will write to CSV in this function ------------

    def csv_writer(data, path):
        
        #Open CSV file whose path we passed.
        with open(path, "wb") as csv_file:
            
            writer = csv.writer(csv_file, delimiter=',')
            for line in data:
                writer.writerow(line)

    

    #---- Define our list here, and call function ------------
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":

        """
        data = our list that we want to write. 
        Split it so we get a list of lists.
        """
        data = ["first_name,last_name,age".split(","),
                "John,Doe,22".split(","),
                "Jane,Doe,31".split(","),
                "Jack,Reacher,27".split(",")
                ]

        # Path to CSV file we want to write to.
        path = "output.csv"
        csv_writer(data, path)

## Appending a String as a newline in a CSV file
    def append_to_csv(input_string):
        with open("fileName.csv", "a") as csv_file:
            csv_file.write(input_row + "\n")
