## Operator Overloading
Everything in Python is an object. Each object has some special internal methods which it uses to interact with other objects. Generally, these methods follow the `__action__` naming convention. Collectively, this is termed as the [Python Data Model](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html). 

You can overload *any* of these methods. This is commonly used in operator overloading in Python. Below is an example of operator overloading using Python's data model. The `Vector` class creates a simple vector of two variables. We'll add appropriate support for mathematical operations of two vectors using operator overloading.

    class Vector(object):
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

        def __add__(self, v):
            # Addition with another vector.
            return Vector(self.x + v.x, self.y + v.y)

        def __sub__(self, v):
            # Subtraction with another vector.
            return Vector(self.x - v.x, self.y - v.y)

        def __mul__(self, s):
            # Multiplication with a scalar.
            return Vector(self.x * s, self.y * s)

        def __div__(self, s):
            # Division with a scalar.
            float_s = float(s)
            return Vector(self.x / float_s, self.y / float_s)

        def __floordiv__(self, s):
            # Division with a scalar (value floored).
            return Vector(self.x // s, self.y // s)

        def __repr__(self):
            # Print friendly representation of Vector class. Else, it would
            # show up like, <__main__.Vector instance at 0x01DDDDC8>.
            return '<Vector (%f, %f)>' % (self.x, self.y, )

    a = Vector(3, 5)
    b = Vector(2, 7)

    print a + b # Output: <Vector (5.000000, 12.000000)>
    print b - a # Output: <Vector (-1.000000, 2.000000)>
    print b * 1.3 # Output: <Vector (2.600000, 9.100000)>
    print a // 17 # Output: <Vector (0.000000, 0.000000)>
    print a / 17 # Output: <Vector (0.176471, 0.294118)>

The above example demonstrates overloading of basic numeric operators. A comprehensive list can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html?object.__getattr__#emulating-numeric-types).
