A tuple is a immutable list of values. Tuples are one of Python's simplest and most common collection types, and can be created with the comma operator (`value = 1, 2, 3`).

## Syntax
* (1, a, "hello") # a must be a variable

* ()  # an empty tuple

* (1,) # a 1-element tuple. `(1)` is not a tuple.

* 1, 2, 3 # the 3-element tuple (1, 2, 3)


Parentheses are only needed for empty tuples or when used in a function call.

A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot like lists. The important difference is that tuples are immutable and are hashable, so they can be used in sets and maps

## Tuple
Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:

    t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'

Although not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses:

    t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

Create an empty tuple with parentheses:

    t0 = ()
    type(t0)            # <type 'tuple'>

To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include a final comma:

    t1 = 'a',
    type(t1)              # <type 'tuple'>

Note that a single value in parentheses is not a tuple:

    t2 = ('a')
    type(t2)              # <type 'str'>

To create a singleton tuple it is necessary to have a trailing comma. 

    t2 = ('a',)
    type(t2)              # <type 'tuple'>

Note that for singleton tuples it's recommended (see [PEP8 on trailing commas](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#when-to-use-trailing-commas)) to use parentheses. Also, no white space after the trailing comma (see [PEP8 on whitespaces](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements)) 

    t2 = ('a',)           # PEP8-compliant
    t2 = 'a',             # this notation is not recommended by PEP8
    t2 = ('a', )          # this notation is not recommended by PEP8

Another way to create a tuple is the built-in function `tuple`.

    t = tuple('lupins')
    print(t)              # ('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')
    t = tuple(range(3))
    print(t)              # (0, 1, 2)

These examples are based on material from the book [**Think Python** by Allen B. Downey][1].

## Tuples are immutable
One of the main differences between `list`s and `tuple`s in Python is that tuples are immutable, that is, one cannot add or modify items once the tuple is initialized. For example:

    >>> t = (1, 4, 9)
    >>> t[0] = 2
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

Similarly, tuples don't have `.append` and `.extend` methods as `list` does. Using `+=` is possible, but it changes the binding of the variable, and not the tuple itself:

    >>> t = (1, 2)
    >>> q = t
    >>> t += (3, 4)
    >>> t
    (1, 2, 3, 4)
    >>> q
    (1, 2)

Be careful when placing mutable objects, such as `lists`, inside tuples. This may lead to very confusing outcomes when changing them.
For example:

    >>> t = (1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3])
    (1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3])
    >>> t[3] += [4, 5]

Will ***both*** raise an error and change the contents of the list within the tuple:
    
    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
    >>> t
    (1, 2, 3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

You can use the `+=` operator to "append" to a tuple - this works by creating a new tuple with the new element you "appended" and assign it to its current variable; the old tuple is not changed, but replaced!

This avoids converting to and from a list, but this is slow and is a bad practice, especially if you're going to append multiple times.

    


## Packing and Unpacking Tuples
Tuples in Python are values separated by commas. Enclosing parentheses for inputting tuples are optional, so the two assignments

    a = 1, 2, 3   # a is the tuple (1, 2, 3)

and

    a = (1, 2, 3) # a is the tuple (1, 2, 3)

are equivalent.
The assignment `a = 1, 2, 3` is also called _packing_ because it packs values together in a tuple.

Note that a one-value tuple is also a tuple. To tell Python that a variable is a tuple and not a single value you can use a trailing comma

    a = 1  # a is the value 1
    a = 1, # a is the tuple (1,)

A comma is needed also if you use parentheses

    a = (1,) # a is the tuple (1,)
    a = (1)  # a is the value 1 and not a tuple


To unpack values from a tuple and do multiple assignments use 

    # unpacking AKA multiple assignment
    x, y, z = (1, 2, 3) 
    # x == 1
    # y == 2
    # z == 3

The symbol `_` can be used as a disposable variable name if one only needs some elements of a tuple, acting as a placeholder:
    
    a = 1, 2, 3, 4
    _, x, y, _ = a
    # x == 2
    # y == 3

Single element tuples:

    x, = 1,  # x is the value 1
    x  = 1,  # x is the tuple (1,)


In Python 3 a target variable with a `*` prefix can be used as a _[catch-all][1]_ variable (see https://www.wikiod.com/python/incompatibilities-moving-from-python-2-to-python-3#Unpacking Iterables ):

<!-- if version <Python 3.x> [gte 3.0] -->
    first, *more, last = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    # first == 1
    # more == [2, 3, 4]
    # last == 5
<!-- end version if -->

## Built-in Tuple Functions
Tuples support the following build-in functions

# Comparison
If elements are of the same type, python performs the comparison and returns the result. If elements are different types, it checks whether they are numbers.

 - If numbers, perform comparison.
 - If either element is a number, then the other element is returned.
 - Otherwise, types are sorted alphabetically .

If we reached the end of one of the lists, the longer list is "larger." If both list are same it returns 0.

    tuple1 = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
    tuple2 = ('1','2','3')
    tuple3 = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')

    cmp(tuple1, tuple2)
    Out: 1
    
    cmp(tuple2, tuple1)
    Out: -1
    
    cmp(tuple1, tuple3)
    Out: 0

# Tuple Length
The function `len` returns the total length of the tuple

    len(tuple1)
    Out: 5

# Max of a tuple
The function `max` returns item from the tuple with the max value

    max(tuple1)
    Out: 'e'
    
    max(tuple2)
    Out: '3'

# Min of a tuple
The function min returns the item from the tuple with the min value

    min(tuple1)
    Out: 'a'
    
    min(tuple2)
    Out: '1'

# Convert a list into tuple
The built-in function `tuple` converts a list into a tuple.

    list = [1,2,3,4,5]
    tuple(list)
    Out: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Tuple concatenation
Use `+` to concatenate two tuples

    tuple1 + tuple2
    Out: ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', '1', '2', '3')




## Tuple Are Element-wise Hashable and Equatable
    hash( (1, 2) )  # ok
    hash( ([], {"hello"})  # not ok, since lists and sets are not hashabe

Thus a tuple can be put inside a `set` or as a key in a `dict` only if each of its elements can.

    { (1, 2) } #  ok
    { ([], {"hello"}) ) # not ok

## Indexing Tuples
    x = (1, 2, 3)
    x[0]  # 1
    x[1]  # 2
    x[2]  # 3
    x[3]  # IndexError: tuple index out of range

Indexing with negative numbers will start from the last element as -1:

    x[-1] # 3
    x[-2] # 2
    x[-3] # 1
    x[-4] # IndexError: tuple index out of range

Indexing a range of elements

    print(x[:-1])   # (1, 2)
    print(x[-1:])   # (3,)
    print(x[1:3])   # (2, 3)

## Reversing Elements
Reverse elements within a tuple

    colors = "red", "green", "blue"
    rev = colors[::-1]
    # rev: ("blue", "green", "red")
    colors = rev
    # colors: ("blue", "green", "red")

Or using reversed (reversed gives an iterable which is converted to a tuple):

    rev = tuple(reversed(colors))
    # rev: ("blue", "green", "red")
    colors = rev
    # colors: ("blue", "green", "red")
