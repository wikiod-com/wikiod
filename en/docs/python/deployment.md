## Uploading a Conda Package
Before starting you must have:

Anaconda installed on your system Account on Binstar If you are not using [Anaconda][1] 1.6+ install the [binstar][2] command line client:


    $ conda install binstar
    $ conda update binstar

If you are not using Anaconda the Binstar is also available on pypi:

    $ pip install binstar

Now we can login:

    $ binstar login

Test your login with the whoami command:

    $ binstar whoami

We are going to be uploading a package with a simple ‘hello world’ function. To follow along start by getting my demonstration package repo from Github:

    $ git clone https://github.com/<NAME>/<Package>

This a small directory that looks like this:

    package/
            setup.py
            test_package/
               __init__.py
               hello.py
               bld.bat
               build.sh
               meta.yaml

`Setup.py` is the standard python build file and `hello.py` has our single hello_world() function.

The `bld.bat`, `build.sh`, and `meta.yaml` are scripts and metadata for the `Conda` package. You can read the [Conda build][3] page for more info on those three files and their purpose.

Now we create the package by running:

    $ conda build test_package/

That is all it takes to create a Conda package.

The final step is uploading to binstar by copying and pasting the last line of the print out after running the conda build test_package/ command. On my system the command is:

    $ binstar upload /home/xavier/anaconda/conda-bld/linux-64/test_package-0.1.0-py27_0.tar.bz2

Since it is your first time creating a package and release you will be prompted to fill out some text fields which could alternatively be done through the web app.

You will see a *`done`* printed out to confirm you have successfully uploaded your Conda package to Binstar.
