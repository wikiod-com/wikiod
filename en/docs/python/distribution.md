## py2app
To use the py2app framework you must install it first. Do this by opening terminal and entering the following command:

    sudo easy_install -U py2app

You can also `pip` install the packages as :
    
    pip install py2app 

Then create the setup file for your python script:

    py2applet --make-setup MyApplication.py


Edit the settings of the setup file to your liking, this is the default:


    """
    This is a setup.py script generated by py2applet
    
    Usage:
        python setup.py py2app
    """
    
    from setuptools import setup
    
    APP = ['test.py']
    DATA_FILES = []
    OPTIONS = {'argv_emulation': True}
    
    setup(
        app=APP,
        data_files=DATA_FILES,
        options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
        setup_requires=['py2app'],
    )

To add an icon file (this file must have a .icns extension), or include images in your application as reference, change your options as shown:

    DATA_FILES = ['myInsertedImage.jpg']
    OPTIONS = {'argv_emulation': True, 'iconfile': 'myCoolIcon.icns'}

Finally enter this into terminal:

    python setup.py py2app

The script should run and you will find your finished application in the dist folder.

Use the following options for more customization:

    optimize (-O)         optimization level: -O1 for "python -O", -O2 for
                          "python -OO", and -O0 to disable [default: -O0]
    
    includes (-i)         comma-separated list of modules to include
    
    packages (-p)         comma-separated list of packages to include
    
    extension             Bundle extension [default:.app for app, .plugin for
                          plugin]
    
    extra-scripts         comma-separated list of additional scripts to include
                          in an application or plugin.

## cx_Freeze
Install cx_Freeze from [here][1]

Unzip the folder and run these commands from that directory:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

Create a new directory for your python script and create a **"setup.py"** file in the same directory with the following content:

    application_title = "My Application" # Use your own application name
    main_python_file = "my_script.py" # Your python script
    
    import sys
    
    from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable
    
    base = None
    if sys.platform == "win32":
        base = "Win32GUI"
    
    includes = ["atexit","re"]
    
    setup(
            name = application_title,
            version = "0.1",
            description = "Your Description",
            options = {"build_exe" : {"includes" : includes }},
            executables = [Executable(main_python_file, base = base)])

Now run your setup.py from terminal:

    python setup.py bdist_mac

**NOTE: On El Capitan this will need to be run as root with SIP mode disabled.**
