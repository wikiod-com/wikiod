## Sqlite3 - Not require separate server process.
The sqlite3 module was written by Gerhard HÃ¤ring. To use the module, you must first create a Connection object that represents the database. Here the data will be stored in the example.db file:

    import sqlite3
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

You can also supply the special name :memory: to create a database in RAM. Once you have a Connection, you can create a Cursor object and call its execute() method to perform SQL commands:

    c = conn.cursor()

    # Create table
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE stocks
             (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)''')

    # Insert a row of data
    c.execute("INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2006-01-05','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)")

    # Save (commit) the changes
    conn.commit()

    # We can also close the connection if we are done with it.
    # Just be sure any changes have been committed or they will be lost.
    conn.close()

## Getting the values from the database and Error handling
Fetching the values from the SQLite3 database.

Print row values returned by select query

    import sqlite3
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("SELECT * from table_name where id=cust_id")
    for row in c:
        print row # will be a list
To fetch single matching fetchone() method

    print c.fetchone()

For multiple rows use fetchall() method

    a=c.fetchall() #which is similar to list(cursor) method used previously
    for row in a:
        print row

Error handling can be done using sqlite3.Error built in function

    try:
        #SQL Code
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print "An error occurred:", e.args[0]
