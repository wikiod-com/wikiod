In Python function will be returned as soon as execution hits "return" statement.


## Return statement inside loop in a function
In this example, function will return as soon as value var has 1

    def func(params):
        for value in params:
            print ('Got value {}'.format(value))

            if value == 1:
                # Returns from function as soon as value is 1
                print (">>>> Got 1")
                return

            print ("Still looping")

        return "Couldn't find 1"

    func([5, 3, 1, 2, 8, 9])

output


    Got value 5
    Still looping
    Got value 3
    Still looping
    Got value 1
    >>>> Got 1
