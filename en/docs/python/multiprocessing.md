## Running Two Simple Processes
A simple example of using multiple processes would be two processes (workers) that are executed separately. In the following example, two processes are started:

- `countUp()` counts 1 up, every second.
- `countDown()` counts 1 down, every second.


    import multiprocessing
    import time
    from random import randint
    
    def countUp():
        i = 0
        while i <= 3:
            print('Up:\t{}'.format(i))
            time.sleep(randint(1, 3)) # sleep 1, 2 or 3 seconds
            i += 1
    
    def countDown():
        i = 3
        while i >= 0:
            print('Down:\t{}'.format(i))
            time.sleep(randint(1, 3)) # sleep 1, 2 or 3 seconds
            i -= 1

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Initiate the workers.
        workerUp = multiprocessing.Process(target=countUp)
        workerDown = multiprocessing.Process(target=countDown)
        
        # Start the workers.
        workerUp.start()
        workerDown.start()

        # Join the workers. This will block in the main (parent) process
        # until the workers are complete.
        workerUp.join()
        workerDown.join()

The output is as follows:

    Up:    0
    Down:    3
    Up:    1
    Up:    2
    Down:    2
    Up:    3
    Down:    1
    Down:    0


## Using Pool and Map
    from multiprocessing import Pool
    
    def cube(x):
        return x ** 3
  
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        pool = Pool(5)
        result = pool.map(cube, [0, 1, 2, 3])

`Pool` is a class which manages multiple `Workers` (processes) behind the scenes and lets you, the programmer, use.

`Pool(5)` creates a new Pool with 5 processes, and `pool.map` works just like [map][1] but it uses multiple processes (the amount defined when creating the pool).

Similar results can be achieved using `map_async`, `apply` and `apply_async` which can be found in [the documentation][2].
