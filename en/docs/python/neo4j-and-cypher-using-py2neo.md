## Adding Nodes to Neo4j Graph
    results = News.objects.todays_news()
    for r in results:
        article = graph.merge_one("NewsArticle", "news_id", r)
        article.properties["title"] = results[r]['news_title']
        article.properties["timestamp"] = results[r]['news_timestamp']
        article.push()
        [...]

Adding nodes to the graph is pretty simple,`graph.merge_one` is important as it prevents duplicate items. (If you run the script twice, then the second time it would update the title and not create new nodes for the same articles)

`timestamp` should be an integer and not a date string as neo4j doesnt really have a  date datatype. This causes sorting issues when you store date as '05-06-1989'

`article.push() ` is an the call that actually commits the operation into neo4j. Dont forget this step.




## Importing and Authenticating
    from py2neo import authenticate, Graph, Node, Relationship
    authenticate("localhost:7474", "neo4j", "<pass>")
    graph = Graph()

You have to make sure your Neo4j Database exists at localhost:7474 with the appropriate credentials.

the `graph` object is your interface to the neo4j instance in the rest of your python code. Rather thank making this a global variable, you should keep it in a class's `__init__` method.

## Adding Relationships to Neo4j Graph
    results = News.objects.todays_news()
    for r in results:
        article = graph.merge_one("NewsArticle", "news_id", r)
        if 'LOCATION' in results[r].keys():
            for loc in results[r]['LOCATION']:
                loc = graph.merge_one("Location", "name", loc)
                try:
                    rel = graph.create_unique(Relationship(article, "about_place", loc))
                except Exception, e:
                    print e

`create_unique` is important for avoiding duplicates. But otherwise its a pretty straightforward operation.
The relationship name is also important as you would use it in advanced cases.



## Query 1 : Autocomplete on News Titles
    def get_autocomplete(text):
        query = """
        start n = node(*) where n.name =~ '(?i)%s.*' return n.name,labels(n) limit 10;
        """
        query = query % (text)
        obj = []
        for res in graph.cypher.execute(query):
            # print res[0],res[1]
            obj.append({'name':res[0],'entity_type':res[1]})
        return res

This is a sample cypher query to get all nodes with the property `name` that starts with the argument `text`.



## Query 2 : Get News Articles by Location on a particular date
    def search_news_by_entity(location,timestamp):
        query = """
        MATCH (n)-[]->(l) 
        where l.name='%s' and n.timestamp='%s'
        RETURN n.news_id limit 10
        """

        query = query % (location,timestamp)

        news_ids = []
        for res in graph.cypher.execute(query):
            news_ids.append(str(res[0]))

        return news_ids

You can use this query to find all news articles `(n)` connected to a location `(l)` by a relationship.



## Cypher Query Samples
Count articles connected to a particular person over time

    MATCH (n)-[]->(l) 
    where l.name='Donald Trump'
    RETURN n.date,count(*) order by n.date

Search for other People / Locations connected to the same news articles as Trump with at least 5 total relationship nodes.

    MATCH (n:NewsArticle)-[]->(l)
    where l.name='Donald Trump'
    MATCH (n:NewsArticle)-[]->(m)
    with m,count(n) as num where num>5
    return labels(m)[0],(m.name), num order by num desc limit 10
