## Create (and write to a) known, persistant temporary file
You can create temporary files which has a visible name on the file system which can be accessed via the `name` property.  The file can, on unix systems, be configured to delete on closure (set by `delete` param, default is True) or can be reopened later.

The following will create and open a named temporary file and write 'Hello World!' to that file.  The filepath of the temporary file can be accessed via `name`, in this example it is saved to the variable `path` and printed for the user.  The file is then re-opened after closing the file and the contents of the tempfile are read and printed for the user.

```
import tempfile

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as t:
    t.write('Hello World!')
    path = t.name
    print path

with open(path) as t:
    print t.read()
```

Output:
```
/tmp/tmp6pireJ
Hello World!
```
