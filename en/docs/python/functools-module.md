## partial
The `partial` function creates partial function application from another function. It is used to *bind* values to some of the function's arguments (or keyword arguments) and produce a *callable* without the already defined arguments.

    >>> from functools import partial
    >>> unhex = partial(int, base=16)
    >>> unhex.__doc__ = 'Convert base16 string to int'
    >>> unhex('ca11ab1e')
    3390155550

`partial()`, as the name suggests, allows a partial evaluation of a function.
Let's look at at following example:

```
In [2]: from functools import partial

In [3]: def f(a, b, c, x):
   ...:     return 1000*a + 100*b + 10*c + x
   ...: 

In [4]: g = partial(f, 1, 1, 1)

In [5]: print g(2)
1112
```
When `g` is created, `f`, which takes four arguments(`a, b, c, x`), is also partially evaluated for the first three arguments, `a, b, c,`. Evaluation of `f` is completed when `g` is called, `g(2)`, which passes the fourth argument to `f`.

One way to think of `partial` is a shift register; pushing in one argument at the time into some function.
`partial` comes handy for cases where data is coming in as stream and we cannot pass more than one argument.

## lru_cache
The `@lru_cache` decorator can be used wrap an expensive, computationally-intensive function with a [Least Recently Used][1] cache. This allows function calls to be memoized, so that future calls with the same parameters can return instantly instead of having to be recomputed.

    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)  # Boundless cache
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n < 2:
            return n
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

    >>> fibonacci(15)

In the example above, the value of `fibonacci(3)` is only calculated once, whereas if `fibonacci` didn't have an LRU cache, `fibonacci(3)` would have been computed upwards of 230 times. Hence, `@lru_cache` is especially great for recursive functions or dynamic programming, where an expensive function could be called multiple times with the same exact parameters.

`@lru_cache` has two arguments 

 - `maxsize`: Number of calls to save. When the number of unique calls exceeds `maxsize`, the LRU cache will remove the least recently used calls.
 - `typed` (added in 3.3): Flag for determining if equivalent arguments of different
   types belong to different cache records (i.e. if `3.0` and
   `3` count as different arguments)

We can see cache stats too:

    >>> fib.cache_info()
    CacheInfo(hits=13, misses=16, maxsize=None, currsize=16)

_NOTE_: Since `@lru_cache` uses dictionaries to cache results, all parameters for the function must be hashable for the cache to work.

[Official Python docs for `@lru_cache`][2]. `@lru_cache` was added in 3.2.

## cmp_to_key
Python changed it's sorting methods to accept a key function. Those functions take a value and return a key which is used to sort the arrays.

Old comparison functions used to take two values and return -1, 0 or +1 if the first argument is small, equal or greater than the second argument respectively. This is incompatible to the new key-function.

That's where `functools.cmp_to_key` comes in:
    
    >>> import functools
    >>> import locale
    >>> sorted(["A", "S", "F", "D"], key=functools.cmp_to_key(locale.strcoll))
    ['A', 'D', 'F', 'S']

Example taken and adapted from the [Python Standard Library Documentation][1].

## total_ordering
When we want to create an orderable class, normally we need to define the methods `__eq()__`, `__lt__()`, `__le__()`, `__gt__()` and `__ge__()`.

The `total_ordering` decorator, applied to a class, permits the definition of `__eq__()` and only one between `__lt__()`, `__le__()`, `__gt__()` and `__ge__()`, and still allow all the ordering operations on the class.

    @total_ordering
    class Employee:
    
        ...
    
        def __eq__(self, other):
            return ((self.surname, self.name) == (other.surname, other.name))
    
        def __lt__(self, other):
            return ((self.surname, self.name) < (other.surname, other.name))

The decorator uses a composition of the provided methods and algebraic operations to derive the other comparison methods. For example if we defined `__lt__()` and `__eq()__` and we want to derive `__gt__()`, we can simply check `not __lt__() and not __eq()__`.

**Note**: The `total_ordering` function is only available since Python 2.7.

## reduce
In Python 3.x, the `reduce` function already explained [here][1] has been removed from the built-ins and must now be imported from `functools`.

    from functools import reduce
    def factorial(n):
        return reduce(lambda a, b: (a*b), range(1, n+1))
