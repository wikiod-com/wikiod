Shelve is a  python module used to store objects in a file. The shelve module implements persistent storage for arbitrary Python objects which can be pickled, using a dictionary-like API.
The shelve module can be used as a simple persistent storage option for Python objects when a relational database is overkill. The shelf is accessed by keys, just as with a dictionary. The values are pickled and written to a database created and managed by anydbm.

**Note:** Do not rely on the shelf being closed automatically; always call `close()` explicitly when you don’t need it any more, or use `shelve.open()` as a context manager:

    with shelve.open('spam') as db:
        db['eggs'] = 'eggs'
<h2>Warning:</h2>

 Because the `shelve` module is backed by `pickle`, it is insecure to load a shelf from an untrusted source. Like with pickle, loading a shelf can execute arbitrary code.

<h1>Restrictions</h1>

**1**. The choice of which database package will be used (such as dbm.ndbm or dbm.gnu) depends on which interface is available. Therefore it is not safe to open the database directly using dbm. The database is also (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of dbm, if it is used — this means that (the pickled representation of) the objects stored in the database should be fairly small, and in rare cases key collisions may cause the database to refuse updates.<br>

**2**.The shelve module does not support concurrent read/write access to shelved objects. (Multiple simultaneous read accesses are safe.) When a program has a shelf open for writing, no other program should have it open for reading or writing. Unix file locking can be used to solve this, but this differs across Unix versions and requires knowledge about the database implementation used.

## Creating a new Shelf
The simplest way to use shelve is via the **DbfilenameShelf** class. It uses anydbm to store the data. You can use the class directly, or simply call **shelve.open()**:

    import shelve
    
    s = shelve.open('test_shelf.db')
    try:
        s['key1'] = { 'int': 10, 'float':9.5, 'string':'Sample data' }
    finally:
        s.close()

To access the data again, open the shelf and use it like a dictionary:

        import shelve
        
        s = shelve.open('test_shelf.db')
        try:
            existing = s['key1']
        finally:
            s.close()
    
    print existing

If you run both sample scripts, you should see:

    $ python shelve_create.py
    $ python shelve_existing.py
    
    {'int': 10, 'float': 9.5, 'string': 'Sample data'}

The **dbm** module does not support multiple applications writing to the same database at the same time. If you know your client will not be modifying the shelf, you can tell shelve to open the database read-only.

    import shelve
    
    s = shelve.open('test_shelf.db', flag='r')
    try:
        existing = s['key1']
    finally:
        s.close()
    
    print existing

If your program tries to modify the database while it is opened read-only, an access error exception is generated. The exception type depends on the database module selected by anydbm when the database was created.

## Sample code for shelve
To shelve an object, first import the module and then assign the object value as follows:

    import shelve 
     database = shelve.open(filename.suffix) 
     object = Object() 
     database['key'] = object 

## To summarize the interface (key is a string, data is an arbitrary object):
    import shelve
    
    d = shelve.open(filename)  # open -- file may get suffix added by low-level
                               # library
    
    d[key] = data              # store data at key (overwrites old data if
                               # using an existing key)
    data = d[key]              # retrieve a COPY of data at key (raise KeyError
                               # if no such key)
    del d[key]                 # delete data stored at key (raises KeyError
                               # if no such key)
    
    flag = key in d            # true if the key exists
    klist = list(d.keys())     # a list of all existing keys (slow!)
    
    # as d was opened WITHOUT writeback=True, beware:
    d['xx'] = [0, 1, 2]        # this works as expected, but...
    d['xx'].append(3)          # *this doesn't!* -- d['xx'] is STILL [0, 1, 2]!
    
    # having opened d without writeback=True, you need to code carefully:
    temp = d['xx']             # extracts the copy
    temp.append(5)             # mutates the copy
    d['xx'] = temp             # stores the copy right back, to persist it
    
    # or, d=shelve.open(filename,writeback=True) would let you just code
    # d['xx'].append(5) and have it work as expected, BUT it would also
    # consume more memory and make the d.close() operation slower.
    
    d.close()                  # close it

## Write-back
Shelves do not track modifications to volatile objects, by default. That means if you change the contents of an item stored in the shelf, you must update the shelf explicitly by storing the item again.

    import shelve
    
    s = shelve.open('test_shelf.db')
    try:
        print s['key1']
        s['key1']['new_value'] = 'this was not here before'
    finally:
        s.close()
    
    s = shelve.open('test_shelf.db', writeback=True)
    try:
        print s['key1']
    finally:
        s.close()

In this example, the dictionary at ‘key1’ is not stored again, so when the shelf is re-opened, the changes have not been preserved.

    $ python shelve_create.py
    $ python shelve_withoutwriteback.py
    
    {'int': 10, 'float': 9.5, 'string': 'Sample data'}
    {'int': 10, 'float': 9.5, 'string': 'Sample data'}

To automatically catch changes to volatile objects stored in the shelf, open the shelf with writeback enabled. The writeback flag causes the shelf to remember all of the objects retrieved from the database using an in-memory cache. Each cache object is also written back to the database when the shelf is closed.

    import shelve
    
    s = shelve.open('test_shelf.db', writeback=True)
    try:
        print s['key1']
        s['key1']['new_value'] = 'this was not here before'
        print s['key1']
    finally:
        s.close()
    
    s = shelve.open('test_shelf.db', writeback=True)
    try:
        print s['key1']
    finally:
        s.close()

Although it reduces the chance of programmer error, and can make object persistence more transparent, using writeback mode may not be desirable in every situation. The cache consumes extra memory while the shelf is open, and pausing to write every cached object back to the database when it is closed can take extra time. Since there is no way to tell if the cached objects have been modified, they are all written back. If your application reads data more than it writes, writeback will add more overhead than you might want.

    $ python shelve_create.py
    $ python shelve_writeback.py
    
    {'int': 10, 'float': 9.5, 'string': 'Sample data'}
    {'int': 10, 'new_value': 'this was not here before', 'float': 9.5, 'string': 'Sample data'}
    {'int': 10, 'new_value': 'this was not here before', 'float': 9.5, 'string': 'Sample data'}
