## Syntax
 - import zipfile
 - *class* zipfile.**ZipFile**(*file, mode='r', compression=ZIP_STORED, allowZip64=True*)

If you try to open a file that is not a ZIP file, the exception `zipfile.BadZipFile` is raised.

In Python 2.7, this was spelled `zipfile.BadZipfile`, and this old name is retained alongside the new one in Python 3.2+

## Opening Zip Files
To start, import the `zipfile` module, and set the filename.

    import zipfile
    filename = 'zipfile.zip'

Working with zip archives is very similar to [working with files][1], you create the object by opening the zipfile, which lets you work on it before closing the file up again.

    zip = zipfile.ZipFile(filename)
    print(zip)
    # <zipfile.ZipFile object at 0x0000000002E51A90>
    zip.close()

In Python 2.7 and in Python 3 versions higher than 3.2, we can use the `with` context manager. We open the file in "read" mode, and then print a list of filenames:

    with zipfile.ZipFile(filename, 'r') as z:
        print(zip)
        # <zipfile.ZipFile object at 0x0000000002E51A90>

## Examining Zipfile Contents
There are a few ways to inspect the contents of a zipfile. You can use the `printdir` to just get a variety of information sent to `stdout`

    with zipfile.ZipFile(filename) as zip:
        zip.printdir()
    
        # Out:
        # File Name                                             Modified             Size
        # pyexpat.pyd                                    2016-06-25 22:13:34       157336
        # python.exe                                     2016-06-25 22:13:34        39576
        # python3.dll                                    2016-06-25 22:13:34        51864
        # python35.dll                                   2016-06-25 22:13:34      3127960
        # etc.

We can also get a list of filenames with the `namelist` method. Here, we simply print the list:

    with zipfile.ZipFile(filename) as zip:
        print(zip.namelist())

    # Out: ['pyexpat.pyd', 'python.exe', 'python3.dll', 'python35.dll', ... etc. ...]

Instead of `namelist`, we can call the `infolist` method, which returns a list of `ZipInfo` objects, which contain additional information about each file, for instance a timestamp and file size:

    with zipfile.ZipFile(filename) as zip:
        info = zip.infolist()
        print(zip[0].filename)
        print(zip[0].date_time)
        print(info[0].file_size)

    # Out: pyexpat.pyd
    # Out: (2016, 6, 25, 22, 13, 34)
    # Out: 157336

## Extracting zip file contents to a directory
Extract all file contents of a zip file

    import zipfile
    with zipfile.ZipFile('zipfile.zip','r') as zfile:
        zfile.extractall('path')

If you want extract single files use extract method, it takes name list and path as input parameter

    import zipfile
    f=open('zipfile.zip','rb')
    zfile=zipfile.ZipFile(f)
    for cont in zfile.namelist():
        zfile.extract(cont,path)



    



## Creating new archives
To create new archive open zipfile with write mode.

    import zipfile
    new_arch=zipfile.ZipFile("filename.zip",mode="w")

To add files to this archive use write() method.

    new_arch.write('filename.txt','filename_in_archive.txt') #first parameter is filename and second parameter is filename in archive by default filename will taken if not provided
    new_arch.close()

If you want to write string of bytes into the archive you can use writestr() method.

    str_bytes="string buffer"
    new_arch.writestr('filename_string_in_archive.txt',str_bytes)
    new_arch.close()
