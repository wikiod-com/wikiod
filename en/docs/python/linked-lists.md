A linked list is a collection of nodes, each made up of a reference and a value. Nodes are strung together into a sequence using their references. Linked lists can be used to implement more complex data structures like lists, stacks, queues, and associative arrays.


## Single linked list example
This example implements a linked list with many of the same methods as that of the built-in list object.

    class Node:
        def __init__(self, val):
            self.data = val
            self.next = None
    
        def getData(self):
            return self.data
    
        def getNext(self):
            return self.next
    
        def setData(self, val):
            self.data = val
    
        def setNext(self, val):
            self.next = val
    
    class LinkedList:
        def __init__(self):
            self.head = None
    
        def isEmpty(self):
            """Check if the list is empty"""
            return self.head is None
    
        def add(self, item):
            """Add the item to the list"""
            new_node = Node(item)
            new_node.setNext(self.head)
            self.head = new_node
    
        def size(self):
            """Return the length/size of the list"""
            count = 0
            current = self.head
            while current is not None:
                count += 1
                current = current.getNext()
            return count
    
        def search(self, item):
            """Search for item in list. If found, return True. If not found, return False"""
            current = self.head

                    current = current.getNext()
            return found
    
        def remove(self, item):
            """Remove item from list. If item is not found in list, raise ValueError"""
            current = self.head
            previous = None
            found = False
            while current is not None and not found:
                if current.getData() is item:

Usage functions much like that of the built-in list.

    ll = LinkedList()
    ll.add('l')
    ll.add('H')
    ll.insert(1,'e')
    ll.append('l')
    ll.append('o')
    ll.printList()

    H
    e
    l
    l
    o
