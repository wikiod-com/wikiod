Threads allow Python programs to handle multiple functions at once as opposed to running a sequence of commands individually. This topic explains the principles behind threading and demonstrates its usage.

## Basics of multithreading
Using the `threading` module, a new thread of execution may be started by creating a new `threading.Thread` and assigning it a function to execute:

    import threading

    def foo():
      print "Hello threading!"

    my_thread = threading.Thread(target=foo)

The `target` parameter references the function (or callable object) to be run.  The thread will not begin execution until `start` is called on the `Thread` object.

***Starting a Thread***

    my_thread.start() # prints 'Hello threading!'

Now that `my_thread` has run and terminated, calling `start` again will produce a `RuntimeError`. If you'd like to run your thread as a daemon, passing the `daemon=True` kwarg, or setting `my_thread.daemon` to `True` before calling `start()`, causes your `Thread` to run silently in the background as a daemon.

***Joining a Thread***

In cases where you split up one big job into several small ones and want to run them concurrently, but need to wait for all of them to finish before continuing, `Thread.join()` is the method you're looking for. 

For example, let's say you want to download several pages of a website and compile them into a single page. You'd do this:

    import requests
    from threading import Thread
    from queue import Queue
    
    q = Queue(maxsize=20)
    def put_page_to_q(page_num):
        q.put(requests.get('http://some-website.com/page_%s.html' % page_num)
    
    def compile(q):
        # magic function that needs all pages before being able to be executed
        if not q.full():
            raise ValueError
        else:
            print("Done compiling!")

    threads = []
    for page_num in range(20):
         t = Thread(target=requests.get, args=(page_num,))
         t.start()
         threads.append(t)

    # Next, join all threads to make sure all threads are done running before
    # we continue. join() is a blocking call (unless specified otherwise using 
    # the kwarg blocking=False when calling join)
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    
    # Call compile() now, since all threads have completed
    compile(q)

A closer look at how `join()` works can be found [here][1].

***Create a Custom Thread Class*** 

Using `threading.Thread` class we can subclass new custom Thread class.
we must override `run` method in a subclass.

    from threading import Thread
    import time
    
    class Sleepy(Thread):
    
        def run(self):
            time.sleep(5)
            print("Hello form Thread")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        t = Sleepy()
        t.start()      # start method automatic call Thread class run method.
        # print 'The main program continues to run in foreground.'
        t.join()
        print("The main program continues to run in the foreground.")

## Communicating between threads
There are multiple threads in your code and you need to safely communicate between them.

You can use a `Queue` from the `queue` library.

    from queue import Queue
    from threading import Thread

    # create a data producer 
    def producer(output_queue):
        while True:
            data = data_computation()
            
            output_queue.put(data)

    # create a consumer
    def consumer(input_queue):
        while True:
            # retrieve data (blocking)
            data = input_queue.get()

            # do something with the data

            # indicate data has been consumed
            input_queue.task_done()

Creating producer and consumer threads with a shared queue

    q = Queue()
    t1 = Thread(target=consumer, args=(q,))
    t2 = Thread(target=producer, args=(q,))
    t1.start()
    t2.start()

## Creating a worker pool
Using `threading` & `queue`:

    from socket import socket, AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM
    from threading import Thread
    from queue import Queue
        
    def echo_server(addr, nworkers):
        print('Echo server running at', addr)
        # Launch the client workers
        q = Queue()
        for n in range(nworkers):
            t = Thread(target=echo_client, args=(q,))
            t.daemon = True
            t.start()
    
        # Run the server
        sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.bind(addr)
        sock.listen(5)
        while True:
            client_sock, client_addr = sock.accept()
            q.put((client_sock, client_addr))

    echo_server(('',15000), 128)

Using `concurrent.futures.Threadpoolexecutor`:

    from socket import AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, socket
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    
    def echo_server(addr):
        print('Echo server running at', addr)
        pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(128)
        sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.bind(addr)
        sock.listen(5)
        while True:
            client_sock, client_addr = sock.accept()
            pool.submit(echo_client, client_sock, client_addr)
    
    echo_server(('',15000))

## Advanced use of multithreads
This section will contain some of the most advanced examples realized using Multithreading.

## Advanced printer (logger) 
A thread that prints everything is received and modifies the output according to the terminal width. The nice part is that also the "already written" output is modified when the width of the terminal changes.

## Stoppable Thread with a while Loop
    import threading
    import time

    class StoppableThread(threading.Thread):
        """Thread class with a stop() method. The thread itself has to check
        regularly for the stopped() condition."""
    
        def __init__(self):
            super(StoppableThread, self).__init__()
            self._stop_event = threading.Event()
    
        def stop(self):
            self._stop_event.set()
    
        def join(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.stop()
            super(StoppableThread,self).join(*args, **kwargs)

        def run()
            while not self._stop_event.is_set():
                print("Still running!")
                time.sleep(2)
            print("stopped!"
