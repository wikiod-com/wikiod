## Parameters
| Parameter| Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| os.F_OK   | Value to pass as the mode parameter of access() to test the existence of path. |
| os.R_OK   | Value to include in the mode parameter of access() to test the readability of path. |
| os.W_OK   | Value to include in the mode parameter of access() to test the writability of path. |
| os.X_OK   | Value to include in the mode parameter of access() to determine if path can be executed. |

## Perform checks using os.access
`os.access` is much better solution to check whether directory exists and it's accesable for reading and writing.

    import os
    path = "/home/myFiles/directory1"
    
    ## Check if path exists
    os.access(path, os.F_OK)
    
    ## Check if path is Readable
    os.access(path, os.R_OK)
    
    ## Check if path is Wriable
    os.access(path, os.W_OK)
    
    ## Check if path is Execuatble
    os.access(path, os.E_OK)

also it's possible to perfrom all checks together

    os.access(path, os.F_OK & os.R_OK & os.W_OK & os.E_OK)

All the above returns `True` if access is allowed and `False` if not allowed.
These are available on unix and windows.
