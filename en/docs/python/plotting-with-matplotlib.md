Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) is a library for 2D plotting based on NumPy.
Here are some basic examples. More examples can be found in the official documentation (https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/gallery.html and https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/examples/index.html) as well as in https://www.wikiod.com/matplotlib

## A Simple Plot in Matplotlib
This example illustrates how to create a simple sine curve using **Matplotlib**

    # Plotting tutorials in Python
    # Launching a simple plot
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # angle varying between 0 and 2*pi
    x = np.linspace(0, 2.0*np.pi, 101)
    y = np.sin(x)                        # sine function
    
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.show()

## Adding more features to a simple plot : axis labels, title, axis ticks, grid, and legend
In this example, we take a sine curve plot and add more features to it; namely the title, axis labels, title, axis ticks, grid and legend.

    # Plotting tutorials in Python
    # Enhancing a plot
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    x = np.linspace(0, 2.0*np.pi, 101)
    y = np.sin(x)
    
    # values for making ticks in x and y axis
    xnumbers = np.linspace(0, 7, 15)
    ynumbers = np.linspace(-1, 1, 11)
    
    plt.plot(x, y, color='r', label='sin') # r - red colour
    plt.xlabel("Angle in Radians")
    plt.ylabel("Magnitude")
    plt.title("Plot of some trigonometric functions")
    plt.xticks(xnumbers)
    plt.yticks(ynumbers)
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid()
    plt.axis([0, 6.5, -1.1, 1.1]) # [xstart, xend, ystart, yend]
    plt.show()

## Making multiple plots in the same figure by superimposition similar to MATLAB
In this example, a sine curve and a cosine curve are plotted in the same figure by superimposing the plots on top of each other.

    # Plotting tutorials in Python
    # Adding Multiple plots by superimposition
    # Good for plots sharing similar x, y limits
    # Using single plot command and legend
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    x = np.linspace(0, 2.0*np.pi, 101)
    y = np.sin(x)
    z = np.cos(x)

    # values for making ticks in x and y axis
    xnumbers = np.linspace(0, 7, 15)
    ynumbers = np.linspace(-1, 1, 11)
    
    plt.plot(x, y, 'r', x, z, 'g') # r, g - red, green colour
    plt.xlabel("Angle in Radians")
    plt.ylabel("Magnitude")
    plt.title("Plot of some trigonometric functions")
    plt.xticks(xnumbers)
    plt.yticks(ynumbers)
    plt.legend(['sine', 'cosine'])
    plt.grid()
    plt.axis([0, 6.5, -1.1, 1.1]) # [xstart, xend, ystart, yend]
    plt.show()

## Making multiple Plots in the same figure using plot superimposition with separate plot commands
Similar to the previous example, here, a sine and a cosine curve are plotted on the same figure using separate plot commands. This is more Pythonic and can be used to get separate handles for each plot.

    # Plotting tutorials in Python
    # Adding Multiple plots by superimposition
    # Good for plots sharing similar x, y limits
    # Using multiple plot commands
    # Much better and preferred than previous
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    x = np.linspace(0, 2.0*np.pi, 101)
    y = np.sin(x)
    z = np.cos(x)

    # values for making ticks in x and y axis
    xnumbers = np.linspace(0, 7, 15)
    ynumbers = np.linspace(-1, 1, 11)
    
    plt.plot(x, y, color='r', label='sin') # r - red colour
    plt.plot(x, z, color='g', label='cos') # g - green colour
    plt.xlabel("Angle in Radians")
    plt.ylabel("Magnitude")
    plt.title("Plot of some trigonometric functions")
    plt.xticks(xnumbers)
    plt.yticks(ynumbers)
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid()
    plt.axis([0, 6.5, -1.1, 1.1]) # [xstart, xend, ystart, yend]
    plt.show()

## Plots with Common X-axis but different Y-axis : Using twinx()
In this example, we will plot a sine curve and a hyperbolic sine curve in the same plot with a common x-axis having different y-axis. This is accomplished by the use of **twinx()** command.

    # Plotting tutorials in Python
    # Adding Multiple plots by twin x axis
    # Good for plots having different y axis range
    # Separate axes and figure objects
    # replicate axes object and plot curves
    # use axes to set attributes
    
    # Note:
    # Grid for second curve unsuccessful : let me know if you find it! :(
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    x = np.linspace(0, 2.0*np.pi, 101)
    y = np.sin(x)
    z = np.sinh(x)

    # separate the figure object and axes object
    # from the plotting object
    fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
    
    # Duplicate the axes with a different y axis
    # and the same x axis
    ax2 = ax1.twinx() # ax2 and ax1 will have common x axis and different y axis

    # plot the curves on axes 1, and 2, and get the curve handles
    curve1, = ax1.plot(x, y, label="sin", color='r')
    curve2, = ax2.plot(x, z, label="sinh", color='b')
    
    # Make a curves list to access the parameters in the curves
    curves = [curve1, curve2]

    # add legend via axes 1 or axes 2 object.
    # one command is usually sufficient
    # ax1.legend() # will not display the legend of ax2
    # ax2.legend() # will not display the legend of ax1
    ax1.legend(curves, [curve.get_label() for curve in curves])
    # ax2.legend(curves, [curve.get_label() for curve in curves]) # also valid
    
    # Global figure properties
    plt.title("Plot of sine and hyperbolic sine")
    plt.show()

## Plots with common Y-axis and different X-axis using twiny()
In this example, a plot with curves having common y-axis but different x-axis is demonstrated using **twiny()** method. Also, some additional features such as the title, legend, labels, grids, axis ticks and colours are added to the plot.
    
    # Plotting tutorials in Python
    # Adding Multiple plots by twin y axis
    # Good for plots having different x axis range
    # Separate axes and figure objects
    # replicate axes object and plot curves
    # use axes to set attributes
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    y = np.linspace(0, 2.0*np.pi, 101)
    x1 = np.sin(y)
    x2 = np.sinh(y)
    
    # values for making ticks in x and y axis
    ynumbers = np.linspace(0, 7, 15)
    xnumbers1 = np.linspace(-1, 1, 11)
    xnumbers2 = np.linspace(0, 300, 7)
    
    # separate the figure object and axes object
    # from the plotting object
    fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
    
    # Duplicate the axes with a different x axis
    # and the same y axis
    ax2 = ax1.twiny() # ax2 and ax1 will have common y axis and different x axis
    
    # plot the curves on axes 1, and 2, and get the axes handles
    curve1, = ax1.plot(x1, y, label="sin", color='r')
    curve2, = ax2.plot(x2, y, label="sinh", color='b')
    
    # Make a curves list to access the parameters in the curves
    curves = [curve1, curve2]
    
    # add legend via axes 1 or axes 2 object.
    # one command is usually sufficient
    # ax1.legend() # will not display the legend of ax2
    # ax2.legend() # will not display the legend of ax1
    # ax1.legend(curves, [curve.get_label() for curve in curves])
    ax2.legend(curves, [curve.get_label() for curve in curves]) # also valid
    
    # x axis labels via the axes
    ax1.set_xlabel("Magnitude", color=curve1.get_color())
    ax2.set_xlabel("Magnitude", color=curve2.get_color())
    
    # y axis label via the axes
    ax1.set_ylabel("Angle/Value", color=curve1.get_color())
    # ax2.set_ylabel("Magnitude", color=curve2.get_color()) # does not work
    # ax2 has no property control over y axis
    
    # y ticks - make them coloured as well
    ax1.tick_params(axis='y', colors=curve1.get_color())
    # ax2.tick_params(axis='y', colors=curve2.get_color()) # does not work
    # ax2 has no property control over y axis
    
    # x axis ticks via the axes
    ax1.tick_params(axis='x', colors=curve1.get_color())
    ax2.tick_params(axis='x', colors=curve2.get_color())
    
    # set x ticks
    ax1.set_xticks(xnumbers1)
    ax2.set_xticks(xnumbers2)
    
    # set y ticks
    ax1.set_yticks(ynumbers)
    # ax2.set_yticks(ynumbers) # also works

    # Grids via axes 1 # use this if axes 1 is used to
    # define the properties of common x axis
    # ax1.grid(color=curve1.get_color())
    
    # To make grids using axes 2
    ax1.grid(color=curve2.get_color())
    ax2.grid(color=curve2.get_color())
    ax1.xaxis.grid(False)
    
    # Global figure properties
    plt.title("Plot of sine and hyperbolic sine")
    plt.show()
