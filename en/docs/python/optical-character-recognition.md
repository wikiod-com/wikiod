Optical Character Recognition is converting images of text into actual text. In these examples find ways of using OCR in python.

## PyTesseract
PyTesseract is an in-development python package for OCR. 

Using PyTesseract is pretty easy:

    try:
        import Image
    except ImportError:
        from PIL import Image

    import pytesseract

        #Basic OCR
        print(pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open('test.png')))

        #In French
        print(pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open('test-european.jpg'), lang='fraâ€™))

PyTesseract is open source and can be found [here][1].

## PyOCR
Another module of some use is `PyOCR`, source code of which is [here][1].

Also simple to use and has more features than `PyTesseract`. 

To initialize:

    from PIL import Image
    import sys
    
    import pyocr
    import pyocr.builders
    
    tools = pyocr.get_available_tools()
    # The tools are returned in the recommended order of usage
    tool = tools[0]
    
    langs = tool.get_available_languages()
    lang = langs[0]
    # Note that languages are NOT sorted in any way. Please refer
    # to the system locale settings for the default language
    # to use.

And some examples of usage:

    txt = tool.image_to_string(
        Image.open('test.png'),
        lang=lang,
        builder=pyocr.builders.TextBuilder()
    )
    # txt is a Python string
    
    word_boxes = tool.image_to_string(
        Image.open('test.png'),
        lang="eng",
        builder=pyocr.builders.WordBoxBuilder()
    )
    # list of box objects. For each box object:
    #   box.content is the word in the box
    #   box.position is its position on the page (in pixels)
    #
    # Beware that some OCR tools (Tesseract for instance)
    # may return empty boxes
    
    line_and_word_boxes = tool.image_to_string(
        Image.open('test.png'), lang="fra",
        builder=pyocr.builders.LineBoxBuilder()
    )
    # list of line objects. For each line object:
    #   line.word_boxes is a list of word boxes (the individual words in the line)
    #   line.content is the whole text of the line
    #   line.position is the position of the whole line on the page (in pixels)
    #
    # Beware that some OCR tools (Tesseract for instance)
    # may return empty boxes
    
    # Digits - Only Tesseract (not 'libtesseract' yet !)
    digits = tool.image_to_string(
        Image.open('test-digits.png'),
        lang=lang,
        builder=pyocr.tesseract.DigitBuilder()
    )
    # digits is a python string
