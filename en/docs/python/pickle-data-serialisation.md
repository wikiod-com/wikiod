## Syntax
- pickle.dump(object,file,protocol) #To serialize an object

- pickle.load(file) #To de-serialize an object

- pickle.dumps(object, protocol) # To serialize an object to bytes

- pickle.loads(buffer) # To de-serialzie an object from bytes



## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| object   | The object which is to be stored   |
| file | The open file which will contain the object | 
| protocol | The protocol used for pickling the object (optional parameter)|
| buffer | A bytes object that contains a serialized object|

# Pickleable types
The following objects are picklable.
- `None`, `True`, and `False`
- numbers (of all types)
- strings (of all types)
- `tuple`s, `list`s, `set`s, and `dict`s containing only picklable objects
- functions defined at the top level of a module
- built-in functions
- classes that are defined at the top level of a module
  - instances of such classes whose `__dict__` or the result of calling `__getstate__()` is picklable (see [the official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickling-class-instances) for details).

Based on the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled).

# `pickle` and security
The pickle module is **not secure**. It should not be used when receiving the serialized data from an untrusted party, such as over the Internet.

## Using Pickle to serialize and deserialize an object
The `pickle` module implements an algorithm for turning an arbitrary Python object into a series of bytes. This process is also called **serializing** the object. The byte stream representing the object can then be transmitted or stored, and later reconstructed to create a new object with the same characteristics.

For the simplest code, we use the `dump()` and `load()` functions.


# To serialize the object
    import pickle
    
    # An arbitrary collection of objects supported by pickle.
    data = {
        'a': [1, 2.0, 3, 4+6j],
        'b': ("character string", b"byte string"),
        'c': {None, True, False}
    }
    
    with open('data.pickle', 'wb') as f:
        # Pickle the 'data' dictionary using the highest protocol available.
        pickle.dump(data, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

---

# To deserialize the object

    import pickle
    
    with open('data.pickle', 'rb') as f:
        # The protocol version used is detected automatically, so we do not
        # have to specify it.
        data = pickle.load(f)

---

# Using pickle and byte objects

It is also possible to serialize into and deserialize out of byte objects, using
the `dumps` and `loads` function, which are equivalent to `dump` and `load`.

```
serialized_data = pickle.dumps(data, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
# type(serialized_data) is bytes

deserialized_data = pickle.loads(serialized_data)
# deserialized_data == data
```


## Customize Pickled Data
Some data cannot be pickled. Other data should not be pickled for other reasons.

What will be pickled can be defined in `__getstate__` method. This method must return something that is picklable.

On the oposite side is `__setstate__`: it will receive what `__getstate__` created and has to initialize the object.

    class A(object):
        def __init__(self, important_data):
            self.important_data = important_data
            
            # Add data which cannot be pickled:
            self.func = lambda: 7
            
            # Add data which should never be pickled, because it expires quickly:
            self.is_up_to_date = False
        
        def __getstate__(self):
            return [self.important_data] # only this is needed
        
        def __setstate__(self, state):
            self.important_data = state[0]
            
            self.func = lambda: 7  # just some hard-coded unpicklable function
            
            self.is_up_to_date = False  # even if it was before pickling


Now, this can be done:

    >>> a1 = A('very important')
    >>>
    >>> s = pickle.dumps(a1)  # calls a1.__getstate__()
    >>>
    >>> a2 = pickle.loads(s)  # calls a1.__setstate__(['very important'])
    >>> a2
    <__main__.A object at 0x0000000002742470>
    >>> a2.important_data
    'very important'
    >>> a2.func()
    7

The implementation here pikles a list with one value: `[self.important_data]`. That was just an example, `__getstate__` could have returned anything that is picklable, as long as `__setstate__` knows how to do the oppoisite. A good alternative is a dictionary of all values: `{'important_data': self.important_data}`.

**Constructor is not called!**
Note that in the previous example instance `a2` was created in `pickle.loads` without ever calling `A.__init__`, so `A.__setstate__` had to initialize everything that `__init__` would have initialized if it were called.
