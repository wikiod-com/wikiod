Functions in Python provide organized, reusable and modular code to perform a set of specific actions. Functions simplify the coding process, prevent redundant logic, and make the code easier to follow. This topic describes the declaration and utilization of functions in Python.

Python has many _built-in functions_ like `print()`, `input()`, `len()`. Besides built-ins you can also create your own functions to do more specific jobs—these are called _user-defined functions_.

## Syntax
 - def *function_name*(*arg1, ... argN, \*args, kw1, kw2=default, ..., \*\*kwargs*): *statements*
 - lambda *arg1, ... argN, \*args, kw1, kw2=default, ..., \*\*kwargs*: *expression*

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| --------- | ------- |
| *arg1*, ..., *argN* | Regular arguments |
| *\*args* | Unnamed positional arguments |
| *kw1*, ..., *kwN* | Keyword-only arguments |
| *\*\*kwargs* | The rest of keyword arguments |


5 basic things you can do with functions:

* Assign functions to variables

      def f():
        print(20)
      y = f
      y()
      # Output: 20

* Define functions within other functions (https://www.wikiod.com/python/functions#Nested functions )

      def f(a, b, y):
          def inner_add(a, b):      # inner_add is hidden from outer code
              return a + b
          return inner_add(a, b)**y

* Functions can return other functions

      def f(y):
          def nth_power(x):
              return x ** y
          return nth_power    # returns a function

      squareOf = f(2)         # function that returns the square of a number           
      cubeOf = f(3)           # function that returns the cube of a number
      squareOf(3)             # Output: 9
      cubeOf(2)               # Output: 8

* Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions

      def a(x, y):
          print(x, y)
      def b(fun, str):        # b has two arguments: a function and a string 
          fun('Hello', str)
      b(a, 'Sophia')           # Output: Hello Sophia
 
* Inner functions have access to the enclosing scope (https://www.wikiod.com/python/functions#Closure )

      def outer_fun(name):
          def inner_fun():     # the variable name is available to the inner function
              return "Hello "+ name + "!"
          return inner_fun
      greet = outer_fun("Sophia")
      print(greet())            # Output: Hello Sophia!

## Defining a function with an arbitrary number of arguments
# Arbitrary number of positional arguments:

Defining a function capable of taking an arbitrary number of arguments can be done by prefixing one of the arguments with a `*`

    def func(*args):
        # args will be a tuple containing all values that are passed in
        for i in args:
            print(i)
    
    func(1, 2, 3)  # Calling it with 3 arguments
    # Out: 1
    #      2
    #      3

    list_of_arg_values = [1, 2, 3]
    func(*list_of_arg_values)  # Calling it with list of values, * expands the list
    # Out: 1
    #      2
    #      3 
    
    func()  # Calling it without arguments
    # No Output 

You **can't** provide a default for `args`, for example `func(*args=[1, 2, 3])` will raise a syntax error (won't even compile).

You **can't** provide these by name when calling the function, for example `func(*args=[1, 2, 3])` will raise a `TypeError`.

But if you already have your arguments in an array (or any other `Iterable`), you **can** invoke your function like this: `func(*my_stuff)`.

These arguments (`*args`) can be accessed by index, for example `args[0]` will return the first argument

# Arbitrary number of keyword arguments

You can take an arbitrary number of arguments with a name by defining an argument in the definition with **two** `*` in front of it:

    def func(**kwargs):
        # kwargs will be a dictionary containing the names as keys and the values as values
        for name, value in kwargs.items():
            print(name, value)
    
    func(value1=1, value2=2, value3=3)   # Calling it with 3 arguments
    # Out: value1 1
    #      value2 2
    #      value3 3
    
    func()                               # Calling it without arguments
    # No Out put

    my_dict = {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2}
    func(**my_dict)                      # Calling it with a dictionary
    # Out: foo 1
    #      bar 2

You **can't** provide these **without** names, for example `func(1, 2, 3)` will raise a `TypeError`.

`kwargs` is a plain native python dictionary. For example, `args['value1']` will give the value for argument `value1`. Be sure to check beforehand that there is such an argument or a `KeyError` will be raised.

# Warning

You can mix these with other optional and required arguments but the order inside the definition matters.

The **positional/keyword** arguments come first. (Required arguments).  
Then comes the **arbitrary** `*arg` arguments. (Optional).  
Then **keyword-only** arguments come next. (Required).  
Finally the **arbitrary keyword** `**kwargs` come. (Optional).

    #       |-positional-|-optional-|---keyword-only--|-optional-|
    def func(arg1, arg2=10 , *args, kwarg1, kwarg2=2, **kwargs):
         pass

- `arg1` must be given, otherwise a `TypeError` is raised. It can be given as positional (`func(10)`) or keyword argument (`func(arg1=10)`).
- `kwarg1` must also be given, but it can only be provided as keyword-argument: `func(kwarg1=10)`.
- `arg2` and `kwarg2` are optional. If the value is to be changed the same rules as for `arg1` (either positional or keyword) and `kwarg1` (only keyword) apply.
- `*args` catches additional positional parameters. But note, that `arg1` and `arg2` must be provided as positional arguments to pass arguments to `*args`: `func(1, 1, 1, 1)`.
- `**kwargs` catches all additional keyword parameters. In this case any parameter that is not `arg1`, `arg2`, `kwarg1` or `kwarg2`. For example: `func(kwarg3=10)`.
- In Python 3, you can use `*` alone to indicate that all subsequent arguments must be specified as keywords. For instance the `math.isclose` function in Python 3.5 and higher is defined using `def math.isclose (a, b, *, rel_tol=1e-09, abs_tol=0.0)`, which means the first two arguments can be supplied positionally but the optional third and fourth parameters can only be supplied as keyword arguments.

Python 2.x doesn't support keyword-only parameters. This behavior can be emulated with `kwargs`:

    def func(arg1, arg2=10, **kwargs):
        try:
            kwarg1 = kwargs.pop("kwarg1")
        except KeyError:
            raise TypeError("missing required keyword-only argument: 'kwarg1'")

        kwarg2 = kwargs.pop("kwarg2", 2)
        # function body ...

Note on Naming
---
The convention of naming optional positional arguments `args` and optional keyword arguments `kwargs` is just a convention you **can** use any names you like **but** it is useful to follow the convention so that others know what you are doing, *or even yourself  later* so please do.

Note on Uniqueness
---
Any function can be defined with **none or one** `*args` and **none or one** `**kwargs` but not with more than one of each. Also `*args` **must** be the last positional argument and `**kwargs` must be the last parameter. Attempting to use more than one of either **will** result in a Syntax Error exception.

Note on Nesting Functions with Optional Arguments
---
It is possible to nest such functions and the usual convention is to remove the items that the code has already handled **but** if you are passing down the parameters you need to pass optional positional args with a `*` prefix and optional keyword args with a `**` prefix, otherwise args with be passed as a list or tuple and kwargs as a single dictionary. e.g.:

    def fn(**kwargs):
        print(kwargs)
        f1(**kwargs)

    def f1(**kwargs):
        print(len(kwargs))

    fn(a=1, b=2)
    # Out:
    # {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
    # 2

## Defining and calling simple functions
Using the `def` statement is the most common way to define a function in python. This statement is a so called *single clause compound statement* with the following syntax:

    def function_name(parameters):
        statement(s)

*`function_name`* is known as the *identifier* of the function. Since a function definition is an executable statement its execution *binds* the function name to the function object which can be called later on using the identifier.

*`parameters`* is an optional list of identifiers that get bound to the values supplied as arguments when the function is called. A function may have an arbitrary number of arguments which are separated by commas.



*`statement(s)`* – also known as the *function body* – are a nonempty sequence of statements executed each time the function is called. This means a function body cannot be empty, just like any [*indented block*](https://www.wikiod.com/python/getting-started-with-python-language#Block Indentation).

Here’s an example of a simple function definition which purpose is to print `Hello` each time it’s called:

    def greet():
        print("Hello")

Now let’s call the defined `greet()` function:

    greet()
    # Out: Hello

That’s an other example of a function definition which takes one single argument and displays the passed in value each time the function is called:

    def greet_two(greeting):
        print(greeting)

After that the `greet_two()` function must be called with an argument: 

    greet_two("Howdy")
    # Out: Howdy

Also you can give a default value to that function argument:

    def greet_two(greeting="Howdy"):
        print(greeting)
Now you can call the function without giving a value:

    greet_two()
    # Out: Howdy 

You'll notice that unlike many other languages, you do not need to explicitly declare a return type of the function. Python functions can return values of any type via the `return` keyword. One function can return any number of different types!

    def many_types(x):
        if x < 0:
            return "Hello!"
        else:
            return 0

    print(many_types(1))
    print(many_types(-1))

    # Output:
    0
    Hello!

As long as this is handled correctly by the caller, this is perfectly valid Python code.

A function that reaches the end of execution without a return statement will always return `None`:

    def do_nothing():
        pass

    print(do_nothing())
    # Out: None

As mentioned previously a function definition must have a function body, a nonempty sequence of statements. Therefore the `pass` statement is used as function body, which is a null operation – when it is executed, nothing happens. It does what it means, it skips. It is useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed.


## Lambda (Inline/Anonymous) Functions
The `lambda` keyword creates an inline function that contains a single expression.  The value of this expression is what the function returns when invoked.

Consider the function:

    def greeting():
        return "Hello"

which, when called as:

    print(greeting())

prints:

    Hello


This can be written as a lambda function as follows:

    greet_me = lambda: "Hello"

> See note at the bottom of this section regarding the assignment of lambdas to variables. Generally, don't do it.

This creates an inline function with the name `greet_me` that returns `Hello`. Note that you don't write `return` when creating a function with lambda. The value after `:` is automatically returned.

Once assigned to a variable, it can be used just like a regular function:

    print(greet_me())

prints:

    Hello

`lambda`s can take arguments, too:

    strip_and_upper_case = lambda s: s.strip().upper()

    strip_and_upper_case("  Hello   ")

returns the string:

    HELLO

They can also take arbitrary number of arguments / keyword arguments, like normal functions. 

    greeting = lambda x, *args, **kwargs: print(x, args, kwargs)
    greeting('hello', 'world', world='world')

prints:

    hello ('world',) {'world': 'world'}

`lambda`s are commonly used for short functions that are convenient to define at the point where they are called (typically with `sorted`, `filter` and `map`). 

For example, this line sorts a list of strings ignoring their case and ignoring whitespace at the beginning and at the end:
 
    sorted( [" foo ", "    bAR", "BaZ    "], key=lambda s: s.strip().upper())
    # Out:
    # ['    bAR', 'BaZ    ', ' foo ']

Sort list just ignoring whitespaces:

    sorted( [" foo ", "    bAR", "BaZ    "], key=lambda s: s.strip())
    # Out:
    # ['BaZ    ', '    bAR', ' foo ']

Examples with `map`:

    sorted( map( lambda s: s.strip().upper(), [" foo ", "    bAR", "BaZ    "]))
    # Out:
    # ['BAR', 'BAZ', 'FOO']

    sorted( map( lambda s: s.strip(), [" foo ", "    bAR", "BaZ    "]))
    # Out:
    # ['BaZ', 'bAR', 'foo']


Examples with numerical lists:

    my_list = [3, -4, -2, 5, 1, 7]
    sorted( my_list, key=lambda x: abs(x))
    # Out:
    # [1, -2, 3, -4, 5, 7]

    list( filter( lambda x: x>0, my_list))
    # Out:
    # [3, 5, 1, 7]

    list( map( lambda x: abs(x), my_list))
    # Out:
    [3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 7]
---
One can call other functions (with/without arguments) from inside a lambda function. 

    def foo(msg):
        print(msg)

    greet = lambda x = "hello world": foo(x)
    greet()

prints:

    hello world
    
This is useful because `lambda` may contain only one expression and by using a subsidiary function one can run multiple statements.

---
**NOTE**

Bear in mind that [PEP-8][1] (the official Python style guide) does not recommend assigning lambdas to variables (as we did in the first two examples):

> Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier.
>
> Yes:
>
>     def f(x): return 2*x
> No:
>
>     f = lambda x: 2*x
> The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is specifically `f` instead of the generic `<lambda>`. This is more useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an explicit `def` statement (i.e. that it can be embedded inside a larger expression).

## Defining a function with optional arguments
Optional arguments can be defined by assigning (using `=`) a default value to the argument-name:

    def make(action='nothing'):
        return action

Calling this function is possible in 3 different ways:

    make("fun")
    # Out: fun

    make(action="sleep")
    # Out: sleep

    # The argument is optional so the function will use the default value if the argument is 
    # not passed in.
    make()   
    # Out: nothing

> # Warning
> 
> Mutable types (`list`, `dict`, `set`, etc.) should be treated with care when given as **default** attribute. Any mutation of the default argument will change it permanently. See [Defining a function with optional mutable arguments][1].



  [1]: https://www.wikiod.com/python/functions#Defining a function with optional mutable arguments

## Defining a function with optional mutable arguments
There is a problem when using **optional arguments** with a **mutable default type** (described in [Defining a function with optional arguments](https://www.wikiod.com/python/functions#Defining a function with optional arguments)), which can potentially lead to unexpected behaviour.

## Explanation ##

This problem arises because a function's default arguments are initialised **once**, at the point when the function is *defined*, and **not** (like many other languages) when the function is *called*. The default values are stored inside the function object's `__defaults__` member variable.

    def f(a, b=42, c=[]):
        pass
    
    print(f.__defaults__)
    # Out: (42, [])

For **immutable** types (see [Argument passing and mutability][1]) this is not a problem because there is no way to mutate the variable; it can only ever be reassigned, leaving the original value unchanged. Hence, subsequent are guaranteed to have the same default value. However, for a **mutable** type, the original value can mutate, by making calls to its various member functions. Therefore, successive calls to the function are not guaranteed to have the initial default value.

    def append(elem, to=[]):
        to.append(elem)      # This call to append() mutates the default variable "to"
        return to
    
    append(1)
    # Out: [1]
    
    append(2)  # Appends it to the internally stored list
    # Out: [1, 2]
    
    append(3, [])  # Using a new created list gives the expected result
    # Out: [3]
    
    # Calling it again without argument will append to the internally stored list again
    append(4)   
    # Out: [1, 2, 4]

> **Note:** Some IDEs like PyCharm will issue a warning when a mutable type is specified as a default attribute.

## Solution ##

If you want to ensure that the default argument is always the one you specify in the function definition, then the solution is to **always** use an immutable type as your default argument.

A common idiom to achieve this when a mutable type is needed as the default, is to use `None` (immutable) as the default argument and then assign the actual default value to the argument variable if it is equal to `None`.

    def append(elem, to=None):
        if to is None:
            to = []
    
        to.append(elem)
        return to

  [1]: https://www.wikiod.com/python/functions#Argument passing and mutability

## Argument passing and mutability
First, some terminology:

- **argument (*actual* parameter):** the actual variable being passed to a function;
- **parameter (*formal* parameter):** the receiving variable that is used in a function.

**In Python, arguments are passed by _assignment_** (as opposed to other languages, where arguments can be passed by value/reference/pointer).

- Mutating a parameter will mutate the argument (if the argument's type is mutable).

      def foo(x):        # here x is the parameter
          x[0] = 9       # This mutates the list labelled by both x and y
          print(x)

      y = [4, 5, 6]
      foo(y)             # call foo with y as argument
      # Out: [9, 5, 6]   # list labelled by x has been mutated
      print(y)           
      # Out: [9, 5, 6]   # list labelled by y has been mutated too

- Reassigning the parameter won’t reassign the argument.

      def foo(x):        # here x is the parameter, when we call foo(y) we assign y to x
          x[0] = 9       # This mutates the list labelled by both x and y
          x = [1, 2, 3]  # x is now labeling a different list (y is unaffected)
          x[2] = 8       # This mutates x's list, not y's list
        
      y = [4, 5, 6]      # y is the argument, x is the parameter
      foo(y)             # Pretend that we wrote "x = y", then go to line 1
      y
      # Out: [9, 5, 6]

**In Python, we don’t really assign values to variables, instead we _bind_ (i.e. assign, attach) variables (considered as _names_) to objects.**


- **Immutable:** Integers, strings, tuples, and so on. All operations make copies.
- **Mutable:** Lists, dictionaries, sets, and so on. Operations may or may not mutate.


    x = [3, 1, 9]
    y = x
    x.append(5)    # Mutates the list labelled by x and y, both x and y are bound to [3, 1, 9]
    x.sort()       # Mutates the list labelled by x and y (in-place sorting)
    x = x + [4]    # Does not mutate the list (makes a copy for x only, not y)
    z = x          # z is x ([1, 3, 9, 4])
    x += [6]       # Mutates the list labelled by both x and z (uses the extend function).
    x = sorted(x)  # Does not mutate the list (makes a copy for x only).
    x
    # Out: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
    y
    # Out: [1, 3, 5, 9]
    z
    # Out: [1, 3, 5, 9, 4, 6]



## Returning values from functions
Functions can `return` a value that you can use directly:

    def give_me_five():
        return 5

    print(give_me_five())  # Print the returned value
    # Out: 5

or save the value for later use:

    num = give_me_five()
    print(num)             # Print the saved returned value
    # Out: 5

or use the value for any operations:

    print(give_me_five() + 10)
    # Out: 15
    
If `return` is encountered in the function the function will be exited immediately and subsequent operations will not be evaluated:

    def give_me_another_five():
        return 5
        print('This statement will not be printed. Ever.')

    print(give_me_another_five())
    # Out: 5

You can also `return` multiple values (in the form of a tuple):

    def give_me_two_fives():
        return 5, 5  # Returns two 5

    first, second = give_me_two_fives()
    print(first)
    # Out: 5
    print(second)
    # Out: 5

A function with _no_ `return` statement implicitly returns `None`. Similarly a function with a `return` statement, but no return value or variable returns `None`.

## Closure
Closures in Python are created by function calls. Here, the call to `makeInc` creates a binding for `x` that is referenced inside the function `inc`. Each call to `makeInc` creates a new instance of this function, but each instance has a link to a different binding of `x`.

    def makeInc(x):
      def inc(y):
         # x is "attached" in the definition of inc
         return y + x
    
      return inc
    
    incOne = makeInc(1)
    incFive = makeInc(5)
    
    incOne(5) # returns 6
    incFive(5) # returns 10

Notice that while in a regular closure the enclosed function fully inherits all variables from its enclosing environment, in this construct the enclosed function has only read access to the inherited variables but cannot make assignments to them

    def makeInc(x):
      def inc(y):
         # incrementing x is not allowed
         x += y  
         return x
    
      return inc

    incOne = makeInc(1)
    incOne(5) # UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment

Python 3 offers the `nonlocal` statement (https://www.wikiod.com/python/variable-scope-and-binding#Nonlocal Variables ) for realizing a full closure with nested functions.

<!-- if version <Python 3.x> [gte 3.0] -->
    def makeInc(x):
      def inc(y):
         nonlocal x
         # now assigning a value to x is allowed
         x += y  
         return x
    
      return inc

    incOne = makeInc(1)
    incOne(5) # returns 6
<!-- end version if -->


## Forcing the use of named parameters
All parameters specified after the first asterisk in the function signature are keyword-only.

    def f(*a, b):
        pass
    
    f(1, 2, 3)
    # TypeError: f() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'b'


In Python 3 it's possible to put a single asterisk in the function signature to ensure that the remaining arguments may only be passed using keyword arguments.

    def f(a, b, *, c):
        pass
    
    f(1, 2, 3)
    # TypeError: f() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
    f(1, 2, c=3)
    # No error

## Defining a function with arguments
Arguments are defined in parentheses after the function name:

    def divide(dividend, divisor):  # The names of the function and its arguments
        # The arguments are available by name in the body of the function
        print(dividend / divisor)

The function name and its list of arguments are called the *signature* of the function. Each named argument is effectively a local variable of the function.

When calling the function, give values for the arguments by listing them in order

    divide(10, 2)
    # output: 5

or specify them in any order using the names from the function definition:

    divide(divisor=2, dividend=10)
    # output: 5



## Recursive functions
A recursive function is a function that calls itself in its definition.
For example the mathematical function, factorial, defined by `factorial(n) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*3*2*1`. can be programmed as

    def factorial(n):
        #n here should be an integer
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return n*factorial(n-1)
the outputs here are:
 
    factorial(0)
    #out 1
    factorial(1)
    #out 1
    factorial(2)
    #out 2
    factorial(3)
    #out 6

as expected. Notice that this function is recursive because the second `return factorial(n-1)`, where the function calls itself in its definition. 

Some recursive functions can be implemented using [lambda][1], the factorial function using lambda would be something like this:

    factorial = lambda n: 1 if n == 0 else n*factorial(n-1)

The function outputs the same as above.

## Recursion limit
There is a limit to the depth of possible recursion, which depends on the Python implementation. When the limit is reached, a RuntimeError exception is raised:
```
def cursing(depth):
  try:
    cursing(depth + 1) # actually, re-cursing
  except RuntimeError as RE:
    print('I recursed {} times!'.format(depth))

cursing(0)
# Out: I recursed 1083 times!
```

It is possible to change the recursion depth limit by using `sys.setrecursionlimit(limit)` and check this limit by `sys.getrecursionlimit()`.

```
sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)
cursing(0)
# Out: I recursed 1997 times!
```

From Python 3.5, the exception is a `RecursionError`, which is derived from `RuntimeError`.

## Nested functions
Functions in python are first-class objects. They can be defined in any scope

    def fibonacci(n):
        def step(a,b):
            return b, a+b
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in range(n):
            a, b = step(a, b)
        return a

Functions capture their enclosing scope can be passed around like any other sort of object

    def make_adder(n):
        def adder(x):
            return n + x
        return adder
    add5 = make_adder(5)
    add6 = make_adder(6)
    add5(10)
    #Out: 15
    add6(10)
    #Out: 16

    def repeatedly_apply(func, n, x):
        for i in range(n):
            x = func(x)
        return x

    repeatedly_apply(add5, 5, 1)
    #Out: 26




## Recursive Lambda using assigned variable


## Defining a function with multiple arguments
One can give a function as many arguments as one wants, the only fixed rules are that each argument name must be unique and that optional arguments must be after the not-optional ones:

    def func(value1, value2, optionalvalue=10):
        return '{0} {1} {2}'.format(value1, value2, optionalvalue1)

When calling the function you can either give each keyword without the name but then the order matters:

    print(func(1, 'a', 100))
    # Out: 1 a 100
    
    print(func('abc', 14))
    # abc 14 10

Or combine giving the arguments with name and without. Then the ones with name must follow those without but the order of the ones with name doesn't matter:

    print(func('This', optionalvalue='StackOverflow Documentation', value2='is'))
    # Out: This is StackOverflow Documentation



## Iterable and dictionary unpacking
Functions allow you to specify these types of parameters: positional, named, variable positional, Keyword args (kwargs). Here is a clear and concise use of each type.

    def unpacking(a, b, c=45, d=60, *args, **kwargs):
        print(a, b, c, d, args, kwargs)

    >>> unpacking(1, 2)
    1 2 45 60 () {}
    >>> unpacking(1, 2, 3, 4)
    1 2 3 4 () {}
    >>> unpacking(1, 2, c=3, d=4)
    1 2 3 4 () {}
    >>> unpacking(1, 2, d=4, c=3)
    1 2 3 4 () {}


    >>> pair = (3,)
    >>> unpacking(1, 2, *pair, d=4)
    1 2 3 4 () {}
