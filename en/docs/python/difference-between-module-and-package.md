It is possible to put a Python package in a ZIP file, and use it that way if you add these lines to the beginning of your script:

    import sys
    sys.path.append("package.zip")

## Modules
A module is a single Python file that can be imported. Using a module looks like this:

`module.py`

    def hi():
        print("Hello world!")

`my_script.py`

    import module
    module.hi()

in an interpreter

    >>> from module import hi
    >>> hi()
    # Hello world!

## Packages
A package is made up of multiple Python files (or modules), and can even include libraries written in C or C++. Instead of being a single file, it is an entire folder structure which might look like this:

Folder `package`

 - `__init__.py`
 - `dog.py`
 - `hi.py`

`__init__.py`

    from package.dog import woof
    from package.hi import hi

`dog.py`

    def woof():
        print("WOOF!!!")

`hi.py`

    def hi():
        print("Hello world!")

All Python packages must contain an `__init__.py` file. When you import a package in your script (`import package`), the `__init__.py` script will be run, giving you access to the all of the functions in the package. In this case, it allows you to use the `package.hi` and `package.woof` functions.
