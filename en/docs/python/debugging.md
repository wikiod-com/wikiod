## The Python Debugger: Step-through Debugging with _pdb_
The [Python Standard Library][1] includes an interactive debugging library called [_pdb_][2]. _pdb_ has extensive capabilities, the most commonly used being the ability to 'step-through' a program.

To immediately enter into step-through debugging use:

    python -m pdb <my_file.py>

This will start the debugger at the first line of the program.

Usually you will want to target a specific section of the code for debugging. To do this we import the pdb library and use _set\_trace()_ to interrupt the flow of this troubled example code. 


    import pdb
    
    def divide(a, b):
        pdb.set_trace()
        return a/b 
        # What's wrong with this? Hint: 2 != 3

    print divide(1, 2)
    
Running this program will launch the interactive debugger. 

    python foo.py 
    > ~/scratch/foo.py(5)divide()
    -> return a/b
    (Pdb) 

Often this command is used on one line so it can be commented out with a single # character

     import pdf; pdb.set_trace()

At the _(Pdb)_ prompt commands can be entered. These commands can be debugger commands or python. To print variables we can use _p_ from the debugger, or python's _print_. 

    (Pdb) p a
    1
    (Pdb) print a
    1

To see list of all local variables use

    locals

build-in function

These are good debugger commands to know:

    b <n> | <f>: set breakpoint at line *n* or function named *f*.
    # b 3
    # b divide
    b: show all breakpoints.
    c: continue until the next breakpoint.
    s: step through this line (will enter a function).
    n: step over this line (jumps over a function).
    r: continue until the current function returns.
    l: list a window of code around this line.
    p <var>: print variable named *var*.
    # p x
    q: quit debugger.
    bt: print the traceback of the current execution call stack
    up: move your scope up the function call stack to the caller of the current function
    down: Move your scope back down the function call stack one level
    step: Run the program until the next line of execution in the program, then return control back to the debugger
    next: run the program until the next line of execution in the current function, then return control back to the debugger
    return: run the program until the current function returns, then return control back to the debugger
    continue: continue running the program until the next breakpoint (or set_trace si called again)
    

The debugger can also evaluate python interactively: 

    -> return a/b
    (Pdb) p a+b
    3
    (Pdb) [ str(m) for m in [a,b]] 
    ['1', '2']
    (Pdb) [ d for d in xrange(5)]
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Note:

If any of your variable names coincide with the debugger commands, use an exclamation mark '**!**' before the var to explicitly refer to the variable and not the debugger command. For example, often it might so happen that you use the variable name '**c**' for a counter, and you might want to print it while in the debugger. a simple '**c**' command would continue execution till the next breakpoint. Instead use '**!c**' to print the value of the variable as follows:

    (Pdb) !c
    4

## Via IPython and ipdb
If [IPython][1] (or [Jupyter][2]) are installed, the debugger can be invoked using:
 
    import ipdb
    ipdb.set_trace()

When reached, the code will exit and print:

     /home/usr/ook.py(3)<module>()
          1 import ipdb
          2 ipdb.set_trace()
    ----> 3 print("Hello world!")
    
    ipdb>
Clearly, this means that one has to edit the code. There is a simpler way:

    from IPython.core import ultratb
    sys.excepthook = ultratb.FormattedTB(mode='Verbose',
                                         color_scheme='Linux',
                                         call_pdb=1)

This will cause the debugger to be called if there is an uncaught exception raised.

## Remote debugger
Some times you need to debug python code which is executed by another process and and in this cases [`rpdb`][1] comes in handy. 

> rpdb is a wrapper around pdb that re-routes stdin and stdout to a socket handler. By default it opens the debugger on port 4444

Usage:

    # In the Python file you want to debug.
    import rpdb
    rpdb.set_trace()

And then you need run this in terminal to connect to this process.

    # Call in a terminal to see the output
    $ nc 127.0.0.1 4444

And you will get pdb promt

    > /home/usr/ook.py(3)<module>()
    -> print("Hello world!")
    (Pdb)
