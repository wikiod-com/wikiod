## Example - Temperature sensor
Interfacing of DS18B20 with Raspberry pi

**Connection of DS18B20 with Raspberry pi**

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

You can see there are three terminal
 1. Vcc
 2. Gnd
 3. Data (One wire protocol)

[![enter image description here][2]][2]

**R1 is 4.7k ohm resistance for pulling up the voltage level**

 1. **Vcc** should be connected to any of the 5v or 3.3v pins of Raspberry pi (PIN : 01, 02, 04, 17).
 2. **Gnd** should be connected to any of the Gnd pins of Raspberry pi (PIN : 06, 09, 14, 20, 25).
 3. **DATA** should be connected to (PIN : 07)

**Enabling the one-wire interface from the RPi side**

 4. Login to Raspberry pi using putty or any other linux/unix terminal.
 5. After login, open the /boot/config.txt file in your favourite browser.

    nano /boot/config.txt

 6. Now add the this line `dtoverlay=w1â€“gpio` to the end of the file.

 7. Now reboot the Raspberry pi `sudo reboot`.

 8. Log in to Raspberry pi, and run `sudo modprobe g1-gpio`

 9. Then run ` sudo modprobe w1-therm`

 10. Now go to the directory /sys/bus/w1/devices `cd /sys/bus/w1/devices`

 11. Now you will found out a virtual directory created of your temperature sensor starting from 28-********.

 12. Go to this directory `cd 28-********`

 13. Now there is a file name **w1-slave**, This file contains the temperature and other information like CRC. `cat w1-slave`.

**Now write a module in python to read the temperature**

    import glob
    import time
    
    RATE = 30
    sensor_dirs = glob.glob("/sys/bus/w1/devices/28*")

    if len(sensor_dirs) != 0:
        while True:
            time.sleep(RATE)
            for directories in sensor_dirs:
                temperature_file = open(directories + "/w1_slave")
                # Reading the files
                text = temperature_file.read()
                temperature_file.close()
                # Split the text with new lines (\n) and select the second line.
                second_line = text.split("\n")[1]
                # Split the line into words, and select the 10th word
                temperature_data = second_line.split(" ")[9]
                # We will read after ignoring first two character.
                temperature = float(temperature_data[2:])
                # Now normalise the temperature by dividing 1000.
                temperature = temperature / 1000
                print 'Address : '+str(directories.split('/')[-1])+', Temperature : '+str(temperature)

Above python module will print the temperature vs address for infinite time. RATE parameter is defined to change or adjust the frequency of temperature query from the sensor.
