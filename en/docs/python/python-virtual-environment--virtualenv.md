A Virtual Environment ("virtualenv") is a tool to create isolated Python environments. It keeps the dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating virtual Python env for them. It solves the “project A depends on version 2.xxx but, project B needs 2.xxx” dilemma, and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable.

"virtualenv" creates a folder which contains all the necessary libs and bins to use the packages that a Python project would need.


## Installation
Install virtualenv via pip / (apt-get):

    pip install virtualenv

OR

    apt-get install python-virtualenv

Note: In case you are getting permission issues, use sudo.



## Usage
     
    $ cd test_proj
Create virtual environment:

    $ virtualenv test_proj
To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:

    $ source test_project/bin/activate

To exit your virtualenv just type “deactivate”:

    $ deactivate






## Install a package in your Virtualenv
If you look at the bin directory in your virtualenv, you’ll see easy_install which
has been modified to put eggs and packages in the virtualenv’s site-packages 
directory. To install an app in your virtual environment:

    $ source test_project/bin/activate
    $ pip install flask

At this time, you don't have to use sudo since the files will all be installed in the local virtualenv site-packages directory. This was created as your own user account.

## Other useful virtualenv commands
**lsvirtualenv** : List all of the environments.

**cdvirtualenv** : Navigate into the directory of the currently activated virtual environment, so you can browse its site-packages, for example.

**cdsitepackages** : Like the above, but directly into site-packages directory.

**lssitepackages** : Shows contents of site-packages directory.
