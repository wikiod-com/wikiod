## Syntax
 - unpickled_string = pickle.loads(string)
 - unpickled_string = pickle.load(file_object)
 - pickled_string = pickle.dumps([('', 'cmplx'), {('object',): None}], pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
 - pickle.dump(('', 'cmplx'), {('object',): None}], file_object, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)
 - unjsoned_string = json.loads(string)
 - unjsoned_string = json.load(file_object)
 - jsoned_string = json.dumps(('a', 'b', 'c', [1, 2, 3]))
 - json.dump(('a', 'b', 'c', [1, 2, 3]), file_object)

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| -------- | ------ |
| `protocol` | Using `pickle` or `cPickle`, it is the method that objects are being Serialized/Unserialized. You probably want to use `pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL` here, which means the newest method. |

Why using JSON?
- Cross language support
- Human readable
- Unlike pickle, it doesn't have the danger of running arbitrary code

Why not using JSON?
- Doesn't support Pythonic data types
- Keys in dictionaries must not be other than string data types.

Why Pickle?
- Great way for serializing Pythonic (tuples, functions, classes)
- Keys in dictionaries can be of any data type.

Why not Pickle?
- Cross language support is missing
- It is not safe for loading arbitrary data

## Serialization using JSON
**JSON** is a cross language, widely used method to serialize data

Supported data types : *int*, *float*, *boolean*, *string*, *list* and *dict*. See -> [JSON Wiki][2] for more

Here is an example demonstrating the **basic** usage of **JSON** :-
```
import json

families = (['John'], ['Mark', 'David', {'name': 'Avraham'}])

# Dumping it into string
json_families = json.dumps(families)
# [["John"], ["Mark", "David", {"name": "Avraham"}]]

# Dumping it to file
with open('families.json', 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(families, json_file)

# Loading it from string
json_families = json.loads(json_families)

# Loading it from file
with open('families.json', 'r') as json_file:
    json_families = json.load(json_file)
```

See [JSON-Module][1] for detailed information about JSON.

## Serialization using Pickle
Here is an example demonstrating the **basic** usage of **pickle**:-
```
# Importing pickle
try:
    import cPickle as pickle  # Python 2
except ImportError:
    import pickle  # Python 3

# Creating Pythonic object:
class Family(object):
    def __init__(self, names):
        self.sons = names

    def __str__(self):
        return ' '.join(self.sons)

my_family = Family(['John', 'David'])

# Dumping to string
pickle_data = pickle.dumps(my_family, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

# Dumping to file
with open('family.p', 'w') as pickle_file:
    pickle.dump(families, pickle_file, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

# Loading from string
my_family = pickle.loads(pickle_data)

# Loading from file
with open('family.p', 'r') as pickle_file:
    my_family = pickle.load(pickle_file)
```

See [Pickle][1] for detailed information about Pickle.

**WARNING**: The official documentation for pickle makes it clear that there are no security guarantees. Don't load any data you don't trust its origin.
