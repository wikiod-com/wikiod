This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files just like the GNU programs gzip and gunzip would.

The data compression is provided by the zlib module.

The gzip module provides the GzipFile class which is modeled after Pythonâ€™s File Object. The GzipFile class reads and writes gzip-format files, automatically compressing or decompressing the data so that it looks like an ordinary file object.

## Read and write GNU zip files
    import gzip
    import os
    
    outfilename = 'example.txt.gz'
    output = gzip.open(outfilename, 'wb')
    try:
        output.write('Contents of the example file go here.\n')
    finally:
        output.close()
    
    print outfilename, 'contains', os.stat(outfilename).st_size, 'bytes of compressed data'
    os.system('file -b --mime %s' % outfilename)

Save it as 1gzip_write.py1.Run it through terminal.

    $ python gzip_write.py
    
    application/x-gzip; charset=binary
    example.txt.gz contains 68 bytes of compressed data
