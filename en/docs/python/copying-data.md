## Copy a dictionary
A dictionary object has the method `copy`. It performs a shallow copy of the dictionary.

    >>> d1 = {1:[]}
    >>> d2 = d1.copy()
    >>> d1 is d2
    False
    >>> d1[1] is d2[1]
    True

## Performing a shallow copy
A shallow copy is a copy of a collection without performing a copy of its elements.

    >>> import copy
    >>> c = [[1,2]]
    >>> d = copy.copy(c)
    >>> c is d
    False
    >>> c[0] is d[0]
    True
    

## Performing a deep copy
If you have nested lists, it is desireable to clone the nested lists as well. This action is called deep copy.

    >>> import copy
    >>> c = [[1,2]]
    >>> d = copy.deepcopy(c)
    >>> c is d
    False
    >>> c[0] is d[0]
    False

## Performing a shallow copy of a list
You can create shallow copies of lists using slices.

    >>> l1 = [1,2,3]
    >>> l2 = l1[:]     # Perform the shallow copy.
    >>> l2
    [1,2,3]
    >>> l1 is l2
    False

## Copy a set
Sets also have a `copy`method. You can use this method to perform a shallow copy.

    >>> s1 = {()}
    >>> s2 = s1.copy()
    >>> s1 is s2
    False
    >>> s2.add(3)
    >>> s1
    {[]}
    >>> s2
    {3,[]}
