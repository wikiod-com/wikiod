## Value vs Handle classes
Classes in MATLAB are divided into two major categories: value classes and handle classes. The major difference is that when copying an instance of a value class, the underlying data is copied to the new instance, while for handle classes the new instance points to the original data and changing values in new instance changes them in the original. A class can be defined as a handle by inheriting from the `handle` class. 

<!-- language: lang-matlab -->
    classdef valueClass
        properties
            data
        end
    end

and

<!-- language: lang-matlab -->

    classdef handleClass < handle
        properties
            data
        end
    end

then 

<!-- language: lang-matlab -->
    >> v1 = valueClass;
    >> v1.data = 5;
    >> v2 = v1;
    >> v2.data = 7;
    >> v1.data
    ans =
         5

    >> h1 = handleClass;
    >> h1.data = 5;
    >> h2 = h1;
    >> h2.data = 7;
    >> h1.data
    ans =
         7


## Defining a class
A class can be defined using `classdef` in an `.m` file with the same name as the class. The file can contain the `classdef`...`end` block and local functions for use within class methods. 

The most general MATLAB class definition has the following structure:

    classdef (ClassAttribute = expression, ...) ClassName < ParentClass1 & ParentClass2 & ...

       properties (PropertyAttributes) 
          PropertyName
       end 

       methods (MethodAttributes) 
          function obj = methodName(obj,arg2,...)
             ...
          end
       end

       events (EventAttributes) 
          EventName
       end

       enumeration
          EnumName
       end

    end

MATLAB Documentation: [Class attributes](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/class-attributes.html), [Property attributes](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/property-attributes.html), [Method attributes](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/method-attributes.html), [Event attributes](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/event-attributes.html), [Enumeration class restrictions](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/enumeration-class-restrictions.html).

### Example class:
A class called `Car` can be defined in file `Car.m` as

<!-- language: lang-matlab -->

    classdef Car < handle % handle class so properties persist
        properties
            make
            model
            mileage = 0;
        end
    
        methods
            function obj = Car(make, model)
                obj.make = make;
                obj.model = model;
            end
            function drive(obj, milesDriven)
                obj.mileage = obj.mileage + milesDriven;
            end
        end
    end


Note that the constructor is a method with the same name as the class. 
<A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes an object of that type. A constructor is an instance method that usually has the same name as the class, and can be used to set the values of the members of an object, either to default or to user-defined values.>

An instance of this class can be created by calling the constructor;

    >> myCar = Car('Ford', 'Mustang'); //creating an instance of car class 

Calling the `drive` method will increment the mileage

    >> myCar.mileage 
        
        ans = 
                0

    >> myCar.drive(450);

    >> myCar.mileage
        
       ans = 
                450

## Constructors
A [constructor][ctor] is a special method in a class that is called when an instance of an object is created. It is a regular MATLAB function that accepts input parameters but it also must follow certain [rules][ctor].

Constructors are not required as MATLAB creates a default one. In practice, however, this is a place to define a state of an object. For example, properties can be restricted by specifying [attributes][propattributes]. Then, a constructor can [initalize][defaultvalue] such properties by default or user defined values which in fact can sent by input parameters of a constructor. 

**Calling a constructor of a simple class**

This is a simple class `Person`.

    classdef Person
        properties
            name
            surname
            address
        end
        
        methods
            function obj = Person(name,surname,address)
                obj.name = name;
                obj.surname = surname;
                obj.address = address;
            end
        end
    end

The name of a constructor is the same the name of a class. Consequently, constructors are called by the name of its class. A class `Person` can be created as follows:

    >> p = Person('John','Smith','London')
    p = 
      Person with properties:

           name: 'John'
        surname: 'Smith'
        address: 'London'

**Calling a constructor of a child class**

Classes can be inherited from parent classes if the share common properties or methods. When a class is inherited from another, it is likely that a constructor of a parent class has to be called.

A class `Member` inherits from a class `Person` because `Member` uses the same properties as the class Person but it also adds `payment` to its definition.

    classdef Member < Person
        properties
            payment
        end

        methods
            function obj = Member(name,surname,address,payment)
                obj = obj@Person(name,surname,address);
                obj.payment = payment;
            end
        end
    end

Similarly to the class `Person`, `Member` is created by calling its constructor: 

    >> m = Member('Adam','Woodcock','Manchester',20)
    m = 
      Member with properties:

        payment: 20
           name: 'Adam'
        surname: 'Woodcock'
        address: 'Manchester'

A constructor of `Person` requires three input parameters. `Member` must respect this fact and therefore call a constructor of the class `Person` with three parameters. It is fulfilled by the line:

    obj = obj@Person(name,surname,address);

The example above shows the case when a child class needs information for its parent class. This is why a constructor of `Member` requires four parameters: three for its parent class and one for itself.

## Inheriting from classes and abstract classes
Disclaimer: the examples presented here are only for the purpose of showing the use of abstract classes and inheritance and may not necessarily be of a practical use. Also, there is no sich thing as polymorphic in MATLAB and therefore the use of abstract classes is limited. This example is to show who to create a class, inherit from another class and apply an abstract class to define a common interface.

The use of abstract classes is rather limited in MATLAB but it still can come useful on a couple of occasions.

Let's say we want a message logger. We might create a class similar to the one below:

    classdef ScreenLogger
        properties(Access=protected)
            scrh;
        end
        
        methods
            function obj = ScreenLogger(screenhandler)
                obj.scrh = screenhandler;
            end
            
            function LogMessage(obj, varargin)
                if ~isempty(varargin)
                    varargin{1} = num2str(varargin{1});
                    fprintf(obj.scrh, '%s\n', sprintf(varargin{:}));
                end
            end
        end
    end

**Properties and methods**

In short, properties hold a state of an object whilst methods are like interface and define actions on objects.

The property `scrh` is protected. This is why it must be initialized in a constructor. There are other methods (getters) to access this property but it is out of cope of this example. Properties and methods can be access via a variable that holds a reference to an object by using dot notation followed by a name of a method or a property:

    mylogger = ScreenLogger(1);                         % OK
    mylogger.LogMessage('My %s %d message', 'very', 1); % OK
    mylogger.scrh = 2;                                  % ERROR!!! Access denied

Properties and methods can be public, private, or protected. In this case, protected means that I will be able to access to `scrh` from an inherited class but not from outside. By default all properties and methods are public. Therefore `LogMessage()` can freely be used outside the class definition. Also `LogMessage` defines an interface meaning this is what we must call when we want an object to log our custom messages.

**Application**

Let's say I have a script where I utilize my logger:

    clc;
    % ... a code
    logger = ScreenLogger(1);
    % ... a code
    logger.LogMessage('something');
    % ... a code
    logger.LogMessage('something');
    % ... a code
    logger.LogMessage('something');
    % ... a code
    logger.LogMessage('something');

If I have multiple places where I use the same logger and then want to change it to something more sophisticated, such as write a message in a file, I would have to create another object:

    classdef DeepLogger
        properties(SetAccess=protected)
            FileName
        end
        methods
            function obj = DeepLogger(filename)
                obj.FileName = filename;
            end
            
            function LogMessage(obj, varargin)
                if ~isempty(varargin)
                    varargin{1} = num2str(varargin{1});
                    fid = fopen(obj.fullfname, 'a+t');
                    fprintf(fid, '%s\n', sprintf(varargin{:}));
                    fclose(fid);
                end
            end
        end 
    end

and just change one line of a code into this:

    clc;
    % ... a code
    logger = DeepLogger('mymessages.log');
    
The above method will simply open a file, append a message at the end of the file and close it. At the moment, to be consistent with my interface, I need to remember that the name of a method is `LogMessage()` but it could equally be anything else. MATLAB can force developper to stick to the same name by using abstract classes. Let's say we define a common interface for any logger:

    classdef MessageLogger
        methods(Abstract=true)
            LogMessage(obj, varargin);
        end
    end
    
Now, if both `ScreenLogger` and `DeepLogger` inherit from this class, MATLAB will generate an error if `LogMessage()` is not defined. Abstract classes help to build similar classes which can use the same interface.

For the sake of this exmaple, I will make slightly different change. I am going to assume that DeepLogger will do both logging message on a screen and in a file at the same time. Because `ScreenLogger` already log messages on screen, I am going to inherit `DeepLogger` from the `ScreenLoggger` to avoid repetition. `ScreenLogger` doesn't change at all apart from the first line:

    classdef ScreenLogger < MessageLogger
    // the rest of previous code 
    
However, `DeepLogger` needs more changes in the `LogMessage` method:

    classdef DeepLogger < MessageLogger & ScreenLogger
        properties(SetAccess=protected)
            FileName
            Path
        end
        methods
            function obj = DeepLogger(screenhandler, filename)
                [path,filen,ext] = fileparts(filename);
                obj.FileName = [filen ext];
                pbj.Path     = pathn;
                obj = obj@ScreenLogger(screenhandler);
            end
            function LogMessage(obj, varargin)
                if ~isempty(varargin)
                    varargin{1} = num2str(varargin{1});
                    LogMessage@ScreenLogger(obj, varargin{:});
                    fid = fopen(obj.fullfname, 'a+t');
                    fprintf(fid, '%s\n', sprintf(varargin{:}));
                    fclose(fid);
                end
            end
        end
    end

Firstly, I simply initialize properties in the constructor. Secondly, because this class inherits from `ScreenLogger` I have to initialize this parrent object as well. This line is even more important because `ScreenLogger` constructor requires one parameter to initalize its own object. This line:

    obj = obj@ScreenLogger(screenhandler);
    
simply says "call the consructor of ScreenLogger and initalize it with a screen handler". It is worth noting here that I have defined `scrh` as protected. Therefore, I could equally access this property from `DeepLogger`. If the property was defined as private. The only way to intialize it would be using consuctor.

Another change is in section `methods`. Again to avoid repetition, I call `LogMessage()` from a parent class to log a message on a screen. If I had to change anything to make improvements in screen logging, now I have to do it in one place. The rest code is the same as it is a part of `DeepLogger`.

Because this class also inherits from an abstract class `MessageLogger` I had to make sure that `LogMessage()` inside `DeepLogger` is also defined. Inheritting from `MessageLogger` is a little bit tricky here. I think it cases redefinition of `LogMessage` mandatory--my guess.

In terms of the code where the a logger is applied, thanks to a common interface in classes, I can rest assure ther changin this one line in the whole code would not make any issues. The same messages will be log on screen as before but additionally the code will write such messages to a file.

    clc;
    % ... a code
    logger = DeepLogger(1, 'mylogfile.log');
    % ... a code
    logger.LogMessage('something');
    % ... a code
    logger.LogMessage('something');
    % ... a code
    logger.LogMessage('something');
    % ... a code
    logger.LogMessage('something');

I hope these examples explained the use of classes, the use of inheritance, and the use of abstract classes.

PS. The solution for the above problem is one of many. Another solution, less complex, would be to make `ScreenLoger` to be a component of another logger like `FileLogger` etc. `ScreenLogger` would be held in one of the properties. Its `LogMessage` would simply call `LogMessage` of the `ScreenLogger` and show text on a screen. I have chosen more complex approach to rather show how classes work in MATLAB. The example code below:

    classdef DeepLogger < MessageLogger
        properties(SetAccess=protected)
            FileName
            Path
            ScrLogger
        end
        methods
            function obj = DeepLogger(screenhandler, filename)
                [path,filen,ext] = fileparts(filename);
                obj.FileName     = [filen ext];
                obj.Path         = pathn;
                obj.ScrLogger    = ScreenLogger(screenhandler);
            end
            function LogMessage(obj, varargin)
                if ~isempty(varargin)
                    varargin{1} = num2str(varargin{1});
                    obj.LogMessage(obj.ScrLogger, varargin{:}); % <-------- thechange here
                    fid = fopen(obj.fullfname, 'a+t');
                    fprintf(fid, '%s\n', sprintf(varargin{:}));
                    fclose(fid);
                end
            end
        end
    end
