# What is the Android NDK?

Android Native Development Kit (NDK) is a companion tool to Android SDK that allows portions of apps to be built in in C/C++. This is useful for:

* Sharing application components across platforms (Android, iOS, Linux, etc.)
* Improving performance for critical portions
* Reusing existing C/C++ libraries

The NDK provides headers and libraries that allow the developer to build activities, handle user input, use hardware sensors, access application resources, and more - all the while programming in C/C++.
