## 1. Basics
Service broker is technology based on asyncronous communication between two(or more) entities.
Service broker consists of:
message types,
contracts,
queues,
services,
routes,
and at least instance endpoints

More: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb522893.aspx

## 2. Enable service broker on database
    ALTER DATABASE [MyDatabase] SET ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;

## 3. Create basic service broker construction on database (single database communication)
    USE [MyDatabase]  
  
    CREATE MESSAGE TYPE [//initiator] VALIDATION = WELL_FORMED_XML;
        GO
    
    CREATE CONTRACT [//call/contract]
    (
        [//initiator] SENT BY INITIATOR 
    )
    GO
    
    CREATE QUEUE  InitiatorQueue;
    GO
    
    CREATE QUEUE  TargetQueue;
    GO
    
    CREATE SERVICE InitiatorService
          ON QUEUE InitiatorQueue
    (
         [//call/contract]    
          
    )
    
    CREATE SERVICE TargetService
    ON QUEUE TargetQueue 
    (
         [//call/contract]    
          
    )
    
    GRANT SEND ON SERVICE::[InitiatorService] TO PUBLIC
    GO
    
    GRANT SEND ON SERVICE::[TargetService] TO PUBLIC
    GO
We dont need route for one database communication. 

## 4. How to send basic communication through service broker
For this demonstration we will use service broker construction created in another part of this documentation. Mentioned part is named **3. Create basic service broker construction on database (single database communication)**.

    USE [MyDatabase]

    DECLARE @ch uniqueidentifier = NEWID()
    DECLARE @msg XML 
    
    BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION @ch
        FROM SERVICE [InitiatorService]
        TO SERVICE 'TargetService'
        ON CONTRACT [//call/contract]
        WITH ENCRYPTION = OFF; -- more possible options
    
            SET @msg = (
                        SELECT 'HelloThere' "elementNum1"
                        FOR XML PATH(''), ROOT('ExampleRoot'), ELEMENTS XSINIL, TYPE
                        );         
          
    SEND ON CONVERSATION @ch MESSAGE TYPE [//initiator] (@msg);
    END CONVERSATION @ch;
After this conversation will be your msg in TargetQueue

## 5. How to receive conversation from TargetQueue automatically

For this demonstration we will use service broker construction created in another part of this documentation. Mentioned part is called **3. Create basic service broker construction on database (single database communication)**.

First we need to create a procedure that is able to read and process data from the Queue

    USE [MyDatabase]
    GO
    
    SET ANSI_NULLS ON
    GO
    SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
    GO
    
    CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[p_RecieveMessageFromTargetQueue] 
        
        AS
        BEGIN
        
        declare 
        @message_body xml, 
        @message_type_name nvarchar(256), 
        @conversation_handle uniqueidentifier,
        @messagetypename nvarchar(256);
    
        
                  
       WHILE 1=1
       BEGIN
        
        BEGIN TRANSACTION
            WAITFOR(
            RECEIVE TOP(1)
            @message_body = CAST(message_body as xml), 
            @message_type_name = message_type_name,
            @conversation_handle = conversation_handle,
            @messagetypename = message_type_name
            FROM DwhInsertSmsQueue
            ), TIMEOUT 1000;
        
             IF (@@ROWCOUNT = 0)
                BEGIN
                    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
                    BREAK
                END
    
             IF (@messagetypename = '//initiator')
                 BEGIN
                    
                    IF OBJECT_ID('MyDatabase..MyExampleTableHelloThere') IS NOT NULL 
                        DROP TABLE dbo.MyExampleTableHelloThere
                    
                    SELECT @message_body.value('(/ExampleRoot/"elementNum1")[1]', 'VARCHAR(50)') AS MyExampleMessage
                    INTO dbo.MyExampleTableHelloThere
                 
                 END
        
               
     
             IF (@messagetypename = 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/SQL/ServiceBroker/EndDialog')
                BEGIN
                    END CONVERSATION @conversation_handle;
                END
       
        COMMIT TRANSACTION
       END
       
    
    END

Second step: Allow your TargetQueue to automatically run your procedure:

    USE [MyDatabase]

    ALTER QUEUE [dbo].[TargetQueue] WITH STATUS = ON , RETENTION = OFF , 
    ACTIVATION
     (  STATUS = ON , --activation status
        PROCEDURE_NAME = dbo.p_RecieveMessageFromTargetQueue , --procedure name
        MAX_QUEUE_READERS = 1 , --number of readers
        EXECUTE AS SELF  )
