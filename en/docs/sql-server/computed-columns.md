## A column is computed from an expression
A computed column is computed from an expression that can use other columns in the same table. The expression can be a noncomputed column name, constant, function, and any combination of these connected by one or more operators.

Create table with a computed column



    Create table NetProfit
    (
        SalaryToEmployee            int,    
        BonusDistributed            int,
        BusinessRunningCost         int,    
        BusinessMaintenanceCost     int,
        BusinessEarnings            int,
        BusinessNetIncome
                    As BusinessEarnings - (SalaryToEmployee          + 
                                           BonusDistributed          + 
                                           BusinessRunningCost       +
                                           BusinessMaintenanceCost    )
                                               
    )

Value is computed and stored in the computed column automatically on inserting other values.



    Insert Into NetProfit
        (SalaryToEmployee,
         BonusDistributed,
         BusinessRunningCost,
         BusinessMaintenanceCost,
         BusinessEarnings)
    Values        
        (1000000,
         10000,
         1000000,
         50000,
         2500000)    
                        
            

## Simple example we normally use in log tables
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[ProcessLog](
    [LogId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
    [LogType] [varchar](20) NULL,
    [StartTime] [datetime] NULL,
    [EndTime] [datetime] NULL,
    [RunMinutes]  AS (datediff(minute,coalesce([StartTime],getdate()),coalesce([EndTime],getdate())))

This gives run difference in minutes for runtime which will be very handy..
