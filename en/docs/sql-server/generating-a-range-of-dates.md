## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| ------    | ------  |
| @FromDate | The inclusive lower boundary of the generated date range. |
| @ToDate   | The inclusive upper boundary of the generated date range. |

Most experts seem to recommend creating a Dates table instead of generating a sequence on the fly.  See http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/86435/filling-in-date-holes-in-grouped-by-date-sql-data

## Generating Date Range With Recursive CTE
Using a Recursive CTE, you can generate an inclusive range of dates:

    Declare  @FromDate    Date = '2014-04-21',
             @ToDate      Date = '2014-05-02'

    ;With DateCte (Date) As
    (
        Select  @FromDate Union All
        Select  DateAdd(Day, 1, Date)
        From    DateCte
        Where   Date < @ToDate
    )
    Select  Date
    From    DateCte
    Option  (MaxRecursion 0)

The default `MaxRecursion` setting is 100.  Generating more than 100 dates using this method will require the `Option (MaxRecursion N)` segment of the query, where `N` is the desired `MaxRecursion` setting.  Setting this to `0` will remove the `MaxRecursion` limitation altogether.

## Generating a Date Range With a Tally Table
Another way you can generate a range of dates is by utilizing a Tally Table to create the dates between the range:

    Declare   @FromDate   Date = '2014-04-21',
              @ToDate     Date = '2014-05-02'

    ;With 
       E1(N) As (Select 1 From (Values (1), (1), (1), (1), (1), (1), (1), (1), (1), (1)) DT(N)),
       E2(N) As (Select 1 From E1 A Cross Join E1 B),
       E4(N) As (Select 1 From E2 A Cross Join E2 B),
       E6(N) As (Select 1 From E4 A Cross Join E2 B),
       Tally(N) As
       (
            Select    Row_Number() Over (Order By (Select Null)) 
            From    E6
       )
    Select   DateAdd(Day, N - 1, @FromDate) Date
    From     Tally
    Where    N <= DateDiff(Day, @FromDate, @ToDate) + 1
