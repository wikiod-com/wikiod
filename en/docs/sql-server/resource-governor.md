Resource Governor in SQL Server is a feature that allows you to manage resource usage by different applications and users. It kicks in realtime by setting CPU and memory limits. It will help preventing that one heavy process will eat up all system resources while for example smaller tasks are awaiting them.

Only available in Enterprise Editions

## Reading the Statistics
    select *

    select *
    from sys.dm_resource_governor_resource_pools



## Create a pool for adhoc queries
First create a resource pool besides the default one

    CREATE RESOURCE POOL [PoolAdhoc] WITH(min_cpu_percent=0, 
            max_cpu_percent=50, 
            min_memory_percent=0, 
            max_memory_percent=50)
    GO

Create the worload group for the pool

    CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP [AdhocMedium] WITH(importance=Medium) USING [PoolAdhoc]

Create the function that contains the logic for the resource governor and attach it

    create function [dbo].[ufn_ResourceGovernorClassifier]()
      returns sysname with schemabinding
    as
    begin
        return CASE
                    WHEN APP_NAME() LIKE 'Microsoft Office%'                        THEN 'AdhocMedium'        -- Excel
                    WHEN APP_NAME() LIKE 'Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio%'    THEN 'AdhocMedium'        -- Adhoc SQL
                    WHEN SUSER_NAME() LIKE 'DOMAIN\username'                    THEN 'AdhocMedium'                -- Ssis
                    ELSE 'default'
                END
    end
    
    GO
    
    alter resource governor 
    with (classifier_function = dbo.ufn_ResourceGovernorClassifier)
    
    GO
    
    alter resource governor reconfigure
    
    GO
