The purpose of the ORDER BY clause is to sort the data returned by a query.

It's important to note that the **order of rows returned by a query is undefined unless there is an ORDER BY clause.**

See MSDN documentation for full details of the ORDER BY clause: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188385.aspx

## Simple ORDER BY clause
Using the [Employees Table][1], below is an example to return the Id, FName and LName columns in (ascending) LName order:

    SELECT Id, FName, LName FROM Employees
    ORDER BY LName

Returns:

| Id | FName | LName 
| ------ | ------ | ------
|2 | John    | Johnson
|1 | James   | Smith
|4 | Johnathon |   Smith
|3 | Michael |  Williams

To sort in descending order add the DESC keyword after the field parameter, e.g. the same query in LName descending order is:

    SELECT Id, FName, LName FROM Employees
    ORDER BY LName DESC

## ORDER BY multiple fields
Multiple fields can be specified for the `ORDER BY` clause, in either ASCending or DESCending order.

For example, using the https://www.wikiod.com/sql/example-databases-and-tables table, we can return a query that sorts by SaleDate in ascending order, and Quantity in descending order.

    SELECT ItemId, SaleDate, Quantity
    FROM [Item Sales]
    ORDER BY SaleDate ASC, Quantity DESC

Note that the `ASC` keyword is optional, and results are sorted in ascending order of a given field by default.

## ORDER BY with complex logic
If we want to order the data differently for per group, we can add a `CASE` syntax to the `ORDER BY`.
In this example, we want to order employees from Department 1 by last name and employees from Department 2 by salary.

| Id | FName     | LName    | PhoneNumber | ManagerId | DepartmentId | Salary | HireDate   |
|:---|:----------|:---------|:------------|:----------|:-------------|:-------|:-----------|
| 1  | James     | Smith    | 1234567890  | NULL      | 1            | 1000   | 01-01-2002 |
| 2  | John      | Johnson  | 2468101214  | 1         | 1            | 400    | 23-03-2005 |
| 3  | Michael   | Williams | 1357911131  | 1         | 2            | 600    | 12-05-2009 |
| 4  | Johnathon | Smith    | 1212121212  | 2         | 1            | 500    | 24-07-2016 |
| 5  | Sam       | Saxon    | 1372141312  | 2         | 2            | 400    | 25-03-2015

    The following query will provide the required results:
    SELECT Id, FName, LName, Salary FROM Employees
    ORDER BY Case When DepartmentId = 1 then LName else Salary end

## Custom Ordering
If you want to order by a column using something other than alphabetical/numeric ordering, you can use `case` to specify the order you want.

`order by Group` returns:

| Group  | Count  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Not Retired|      6|
| Retired|      4|
| Total  |      10|

`order by case group when 'Total' then 1 when 'Retired' then 2 else 3 end` returns:

| Group  | Count  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Total  |      10|
| Retired|      4|
| Not Retired|      6|
