Row Offset and Paging in Various Versions of SQL Server

## Syntax
- SELECT * FROM TableName ORDER BY id OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;

## Pagination using ROW_NUMBER with a Common Table Expression
<!-- if version [gte SQL Server 2008] -->

The `ROW_NUMBER` function can assign an incrementing number to each row in a result set. Combined with a [Common Table Expression][1] that uses a `BETWEEN` operator, it is possible to create 'pages' of result sets. For example: page one containing results 1-10, page two containing results 11-20, page three containing results 21-30, and so on.

    WITH data
    AS
    (
        SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY name) AS row_id,
            object_id,
            name, 
            type,
            create_date
        FROM sys.objects
    )
    SELECT *
    FROM data
    WHERE row_id BETWEEN 41 AND 50

Note: It is not possible to use `ROW_NUMBER` in a `WHERE` clause like:

    SELECT object_id,
        name,
        type,
        create_date
    FROM sys.objects
    WHERE ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY name) BETWEEN 41 AND 50

Although this would be more convenient, SQL server will return the following error in this case:

> Msg 4108, Level 15, State 1, Line 6
>
> Windowed functions can only appear in the SELECT or ORDER BY clauses.

<!-- end version if -->

## Pagination with OFFSET FETCH
<!-- if version [gte SQL Server 2012] -->

The `OFFSET FETCH` clause implements pagination in a more concise manner. With it, it's possible to skip N1 rows (specified in `OFFSET`) and return the next N2 rows (specified in `FETCH`):

    SELECT *
    FROM sys.objects
    ORDER BY object_id
    OFFSET 40 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY

The `ORDER BY` clause is required in order to provide deterministic results.

<!-- end version if -->

## Paginaton with inner query
In earlier versions of SQL Server, developers had to use double sorting combined with the `TOP` keyword to return rows in a page:

     SELECT TOP 10 *
     FROM
     (
        SELECT
        TOP 50 object_id,
            name,
            type,
            create_date
        FROM sys.objects
        ORDER BY name ASC
    ) AS data
    ORDER BY name DESC

The inner query will return the first 50 rows ordered by `name`. Then the outer query will reverse the order of these 50 rows and select the top 10 rows (these will be last 10 rows in the group before the reversal).

## Paging in Various Versions of SQL Server
# **SQL Server 2012 / 2014**
----------


    DECLARE @RowsPerPage INT = 10, @PageNumber INT = 4
    SELECT OrderId, ProductId
    FROM OrderDetail
    ORDER BY OrderId
    OFFSET (@PageNumber - 1) * @RowsPerPage ROWS
    FETCH NEXT @RowsPerPage ROWS ONLY


# **SQL Server 2005/2008/R2** 
----------

    DECLARE @RowsPerPage INT = 10, @PageNumber INT = 4
    SELECT OrderId, ProductId
    FROM (
        SELECT OrderId, ProductId, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY OrderId) AS RowNum
        FROM OrderDetail) AS OD
    WHERE OD.RowNum BETWEEN ((@PageNumber - 1 ) * @RowsPerPage) + 1
    AND @RowsPerPage * @PageNumber


# **SQL Server 2000**
----------

    DECLARE @RowsPerPage INT = 10, @PageNumber INT = 4
    SELECT OrderId, ProductId
    FROM (SELECT TOP (@RowsPerPage) OrderId, ProductId
            FROM (SELECT TOP ((@PageNumber)*@RowsPerPage) OrderId, ProductId
                    FROM OrderDetail
                    ORDER BY OrderId) AS OD
        ORDER BY OrderId DESC) AS OD2
    ORDER BY OrderId ASC

## SQL Server 2012/2014 using ORDER BY OFFSET and FETCH NEXT
For getting the next 10 rows just run this query:

    SELECT * FROM TableName ORDER BY id OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;

**Key points to consider when using it:**

 - `ORDER BY` is mandatory to use `OFFSET` and `FETCH` clause.
 - `OFFSET` clause is mandatory with `FETCH`. You can never use, `ORDER BY` â€¦
   `FETCH`.
 - `TOP` cannot be combined with `OFFSET` and `FETCH` in the same query
   expression.
