## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| character_expression  | the existing string in your data   |
| start_position | the position in `character_expression` to delete `length` and then insert the `replacement_string` |
| length | the number of characters to delete from `character_expression` |
| replacement_string | the sequence of characters to insert in `character_expression` |


## Using FOR XML to Concatenate Values from Multiple Rows
One common use for the `FOR XML` function is to concatenate the values of multiple rows. 

Here's an example using the [Customers table](https://www.wikiod.com/sql/example-databases-and-tables): 


    SELECT 
        STUFF( (SELECT ';' + Email
            FROM Customers 
            where (Email is not null and Email <> '')
            ORDER BY Email ASC 
            FOR XML PATH('')), 
        1, 1, '')

In the example above, `FOR XML PATH(''))` is being used to concatenate email addresses, using `;` as the delimiter character. Also, the purpose of `STUFF` is to remove the leading `;` from the concatenated string. `STUFF` is also implicitly casting the concatenated string from XML to varchar.

Note: the result from the above example will be XML-encoded, meaning it will replace `<` characters with `&lt;` etc. If you don't want this, change `FOR XML PATH(''))` to `FOR XML PATH, TYPE).value('.[1]','varchar(MAX)')`, e.g.: 


    SELECT 
        STUFF( (SELECT ';' + Email
            FROM Customers 
            where (Email is not null and Email <> '')
            ORDER BY Email ASC 
            FOR XML PATH, TYPE).value('.[1]','varchar(900)'),
        1, 1, '')

This can be used to achieve a result similar to `GROUP_CONCAT` in MySQL or `string_agg` in PostgreSQL 9.0+, although we use subqueries instead of GROUP BY aggregates. (As an alternative, you can install a user-defined aggregate such as [this one](https://groupconcat.codeplex.com/) if you're looking for functionality closer to that of `GROUP_CONCAT`).

## Basic Character Replacement with STUFF()
The `STUFF()` function inserts a string into another string by first deleting a specified number of characters.  The following example, deletes "Svr" and replaces it with "Server". This happens by specifying the `start_position` and `length` of the replacement. 

    SELECT STUFF('SQL Svr Documentation', 5, 3, 'Server')

Executing this example will result in returning `SQL Server Documentation` instead of `SQL Svr Documentation.` 

## Basic Example of STUFF() function.
STUFF(Original_Expression, Start, Length, Replacement_expression)

STUFF() function inserts Replacement_expression, at the start position specified, along with removing the characters specified using Length parameter.

     Select FirstName, LastName,Email, STUFF(Email, 2, 3, '*****') as StuffedEmail From Employee

**Executing this example will result in returning the given table**

| FirstName | LastName | Email |StuffedEmail |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Jomes   | Hunter   |James@hotmail.com| J*****s@hotmail.com|
| Shyam   | rathod   |Shyam@hotmail.com| S*****m@hotmail.com|
| Ram   | shinde   |Ram@hotmail.com| R*****hotmail.com|







## Obtain column names separated with comma (not a list)
    /*
    The result can be use for fast way to use columns on Insertion/Updates.
    Works with tables and views.

    Example: eTableColumns  'Customers'
    ColumnNames
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Id, FName, LName, Email, PhoneNumber, PreferredContact

    INSERT INTO Customers (Id, FName, LName, Email, PhoneNumber, PreferredContact)
        VALUES (5, 'Ringo', 'Star', 'two@beatles.now', NULL, 'EMAIL')
    */
    CREATE PROCEDURE eTableColumns (@Table VARCHAR(100))
    AS
    SELECT ColumnNames = 
       STUFF( (SELECT ', ' +  c.name
    FROM    
        sys.columns c
    INNER JOIN 
        sys.types t ON c.user_type_id = t.user_type_id
    WHERE
        c.object_id = OBJECT_ID( @Table)
            FOR XML PATH, TYPE).value('.[1]','varchar(2000)'),
        1, 1, '')
    GO



## stuff for comma separated in sql server
`FOR XML PATH` and `STUFF` to concatenate the multiple rows into a single row: 

 

      select distinct t1.id,
          STUFF(
                 (SELECT ', ' + convert(varchar(10), t2.date, 120)
                  FROM yourtable t2
                  where t1.id = t2.id
                  FOR XML PATH (''))
                  , 1, 1, '')  AS date
        from yourtable t1;
