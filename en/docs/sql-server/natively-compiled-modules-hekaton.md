## Natively compiled stored procedure
In a procedure with native compilation, T-SQL code is compiled to dll and executed as native C code. To create a Native Compiled stored Procedure you need to:
 - Use standard CREATE PROCEDURE syntax
 - Set NATIVE_COMPILATION option in stored procedure definition
 - Use SCHEMABINDING option in stored procedure definition
 - Define EXECUTE AS OWNER option in stored procedure definition

Instead of standard BEGIN END block, you need to use BEGIN ATOMIC block:

    BEGIN ATOMIC
       WITH (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL=SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE='us_english')
       -- T-Sql code goes here
    END

Example:

    CREATE PROCEDURE usp_LoadMemOptTable (@maxRows INT, @FullName NVARCHAR(200))
    WITH
        NATIVE_COMPILATION, 
        SCHEMABINDING, 
        EXECUTE AS OWNER
    AS
    BEGIN ATOMIC
    WITH (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL=SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE='us_english')
        DECLARE @i INT = 1
        WHILE @i <= @maxRows
        BEGIN
            INSERT INTO dbo.MemOptTable3 VALUES(@i, @FullName, GETDATE())
            SET @i = @i+1
        END
    END
    GO

## Natively compiled scalar function
Code in natively compiled function will be transformed into C code and compiled as dll. To create a Native Compiled scalar function you need to:
 - Use standard CREATE FUNCTION syntax
 - Set NATIVE_COMPILATION option in function definition
 - Use SCHEMABINDING option in function definition

Instead of standard BEGIN END block, you need to use BEGIN ATOMIC block:

    BEGIN ATOMIC
       WITH (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL=SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE='us_english')
       -- T-Sql code goes here
    END

Example:

    CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[udfMultiply]( @v1 int, @v2 int )   
    RETURNS bigint 
    WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION, SCHEMABINDING  
    AS   
    BEGIN ATOMIC WITH (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL = SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE = N'English')  
      
        DECLARE @ReturnValue bigint;  
        SET @ReturnValue = @v1 * @v2;         
      
        RETURN (@ReturnValue);    
    END 
    
    -- usage sample:
    SELECT dbo.udfMultiply(10, 12)

## Native inline table value function
Native compiled table value function returns table as result. Code in natively compiled function will be transformed into C code and compiled as dll.  Only inline table valued functions are supported in version 2016. To create a native table value function you need to:
 - Use standard CREATE FUNCTION syntax
 - Set NATIVE_COMPILATION option in function definition
 - Use SCHEMABINDING option in function definition

Instead of standard BEGIN END block, you need to use BEGIN ATOMIC block:

    BEGIN ATOMIC
       WITH (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL=SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE='us_english')
       -- T-Sql code goes here
    END

Example:

    CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[udft_NativeGetBusinessDoc]
    (
       @RunDate VARCHAR(25)
    )
    RETURNS TABLE
    WITH SCHEMABINDING,
         NATIVE_COMPILATION
    AS
         RETURN
    (
        SELECT BusinessDocNo,
               ProductCode,
               UnitID,               
               ReasonID,
               PriceID,
               RunDate,
               ReturnPercent,
               Qty,
               RewardAmount,
               ModifyDate,
               UserID
        FROM dbo.[BusinessDocDetail_11]
        WHERE RunDate >= @RunDate
    );
