[**Gulp**][1] is a JavaScript build system, node.js-based task runner like Grunt. It allows you to automate common tasks during your development process. Gulp uses the [streams][2]-concept and code-over-configuration for a simpler and more intuitive build process. The code-over-configuration concept allows to create more readable and simple tasks, whereas [tag:Grunt] tasks are highly over-configured.
