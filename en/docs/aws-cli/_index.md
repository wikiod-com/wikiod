# Description

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI introduces a new set of simple file commands for efficient file transfers to and from Amazon S3.

# Supported Services

For a list of the available services you can use with AWS Command Line Interface, see [Available Services][1] in the AWS CLI Command Reference.

# AWS Command Line Interface on GitHub

You can view—and fork—the source code for the AWS CLI on GitHub in the https://github.com/aws/aws-cli project.
