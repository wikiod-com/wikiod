## Introduction to "context.getImageData"
Html5 Canvas gives you the ability to fetch and change the color of any pixel on the canvas.

**You can use Canvas's pixel manipulation to:**

* Create a color-picker for an image or select a color on a color-wheel.
* Create complex image filters like blurring and edge detection.
* Recolor any part of an image at the pixel level (if you use HSL you can even recolor an image while retaining the important Lighting & Saturation so the result doesn't look like someone slapped paint on the image). Note: Canvas now has Blend Compositing that can also recolor an image in some cases.
* "Knockout" the background around a person/item in an image,
* Create a paint-bucket tool to detect and Floodfill part of an image (eg, change the color of a user-clicked flower petal from green to yellow).
* Examine an image for content (eg. facial recognition).

**Common issues:**

* For security reasons, `getImageData` is disabled if you have drawn an image originating on a different domain than the web page itself. 
* `getImageData` is a relatively expensive method because it creates a large pixel-data array and because it does not use the GPU to assist its efforts. Note: Canvas now has blend compositing that can do some of the same pixel manipulation that `getImageData` does.
* For .png images, `getImageData` might not report the exact same colors as in the original .png file because the browser is allowed to do gamma-correction and alpha-premultiplication when drawing images on the canvas.

**Getting pixel colors**

Use `getImageData` to fetch the pixel colors for all or part of your canvas content.

The `getImageData` method returns an `imageData` object 

The `imageData` object has a `.data` property that contains the pixel color information. 

The `data` property is a `Uint8ClampedArray` containing the Red, Green, Blue & Alpha (opacity) color data for all requested pixels. 

    // determine which pixels to fetch (this fetches all pixels on the canvas)
    var x=0;
    var y=0;
    var width=canvas.width;
    var height=canvas.height;

    // Fetch the imageData object 
    var imageData = context.getImageData(x,y,width,height);

    // Pull the pixel color data array from the imageData object
    var pixelDataArray = imageData.data;


You can get position of any [x,y] pixel within `data` array like this:

    // the data[] array position for pixel [x,y]
    var n = y * canvas.width + x;

And then you can fetch that pixel's red, green, blue & alpha values like this:

    // the RGBA info for pixel [x,y]
    var red=data[n];
    var green=data[n+1];
    var blue=data[n+2];
    var alpha=data[n+3];
 

# An Illustration showing how the pixel data array is structured

`context.getImageData` is illustrated below for a small 2x3 pixel sized canvas:
