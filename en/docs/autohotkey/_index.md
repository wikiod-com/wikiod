AutoHotkey is a [free][1], [open-source][2] custom [scripting][3] [language][4] for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy [keyboard shortcuts][5] or hotkeys, fast [macro][6]-creation and [software][7] [automation][8] that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application. User interfaces can easily be extended or modified by AutoHotkey (for example, overriding the default Windows [control key][9] commands with their [Emacs][10] equivalents). The Autohotkey installation includes its own extensive help file with an always updated [web based][11] version.

You can write [mouse or keyboard macros][12], [remap keys][13], create [hotkeys][14], [expand][15] abbreviations, [change clipboard contents][16], and make [executables][17] to run hotkey scripts on computers without AutoHotkey installed.
