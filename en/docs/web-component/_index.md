Web Components are a set of new web technologies implemented in modern web browsers, and used to design reusable web elements with the only help of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

Topics covered by the term *Web Compoments* are:

 - Custom Elements
   
 - HTML Templates
   
 - Shadow DOM
   
 - HTML Imports

These technologies are complementary, and can be used together or separately.
