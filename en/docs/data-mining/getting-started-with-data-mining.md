## Related topics to data mining
Data mining is a wide topic, and the term is (unfortunately) very liberally thrown at any topic that involves data processing. Because of this **this "documentation" should never have been created in the first place**, because it overlaps with other topcis too much, and everything is better discussed elsewhere. And of course, this is not a programming language, or API.

Because of overlap with other topics, distinguish data-mining from:

* [Machine learning][1]: analyzing data with artificial intelligence, e.g. to learn patterns from (usually labeled) data.
* [Web scraping][2] and data collection: the process of data aquisition is already documented in these more specific tags, and often not considered to be part of data mining, but rather a prerequisite
* [big data][3] can be done without any analysis. It is another related topic of its own.
* [Statistics][4]. Much of the heavy lifting in data mining is applied statistics.
* ... many more.

Seriously. You really should look elsewhere.
