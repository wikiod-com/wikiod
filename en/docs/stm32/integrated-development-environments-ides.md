The purpose of this topic is to list all integrated development environments (IDE) that can be used to develop software for STM32 microcontrollers. The examples should contain:

1. List of the IDE's main features.
2. List of the operating systems supported by the IDE.
3. Installation process.
4. Additional configuration steps (if there are any).
