The spaceship operator is used for comparing two expressions. For example, $a <=> $b returns -1, 0 or 1 when $a is respectively less than, equal to, or greater than $b. Comparisons are performed according to PHP's usual type comparison rules.

## Sorting a list of numbers
<!-- language: lang-php -->

    $array = [1, 0, 5, 9, 3, 7, 6, 8, 4, 2];

    usort($array, function (int $a, int $b): int {
        return $a <=> $b;
    });

    print_r($array);

```
Array
(
    [0] => 0
    [1] => 1
    [2] => 2
    [3] => 3
    [4] => 4
    [5] => 5
    [6] => 6
    [7] => 7
    [8] => 8
    [9] => 9
)
```

## Simple Example
```
$a = 5;
$b = 10;

$a <=> $a; // 0, because $a == $a
$a <=> $b; // -1, because $a < $b
$b <=> $a; // 1, because $b > $a 
```

## Generic numerical example
Generic example in a form of `$a <=> $b` matrix.

<!-- language: lang-php -->

    0 <=> 1; // -1 (left operand less than right, right is greater)
    0 <=> 0; // 0 (operands are equal)
    1 <=> 0; // 1 (left operand greater than right, left is greater)
    1 <=> 1; // 0 (operands are equal)
