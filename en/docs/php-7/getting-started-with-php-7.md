## PHP-7, better and new.
After php 5.4. 5.5 and 5.6 this new mayor update came. The update comes with many new programming features, techniques and ways of writing code. Installing PHP 7 could be done in multiple ways.

To install it for a localhost development like WAMP or XAMPP either check for software updates from their end and see if they come with the new PHP 7, If not you could always [download](http://php.net/downloads.php) a new PHP version. Note that by now PHP 7.1.4 is already released in its early state. If you've downloaded the new version don't forget to implement it the right way so that you're able to use it. Doing this could be established by following the following tutorial for WAMP: [tutorial](https://john-dugan.com/upgrade-php-wamp/) and the following turorial for XAMPP: [tutorial](http://www.techflirt.com/how-to-upgrade-php7-in-xampp)
<br>
<br>
**Update a servers PHP version**<br>
If you have your own server to host your websites on updating PHP could be established in multiple different ways. From a `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` command it could work. But a better way is to download the new package with for linux <br>`sudo apt-get install python-software-properties software-properties-common`<br>`
sudo LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php`<br>`
sudo apt-get update`
<br><br>
When you've updated PHP you're able to use many new functions and features. Next to that there are also speed improvements that came with this update.
<br><br>
Now you only need to check if PHP-7 had been installed by running the following command: <br>

    php -v

The output should be something like this.
