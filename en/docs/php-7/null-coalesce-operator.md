The `null` coalescing operator (**`??`**) has been added as syntactic sugar for the common case of needing to use a ternary in conjunction with `isset()`.

It returns its first operand if it exists and is not `NULL`; otherwise it returns its second operand.

## General usage
<!-- language: lang-php -->

    // Fetches the value of $_GET['id'] and returns 0 if it does not exist.
    $id = $_GET['id'] ?? 0;
    // This is equivalent to:
    $id = isset($_GET['id']) ? $_GET['id'] : 0;

    // Coalescing can be chained: this will return the first defined value out of 
    // $_GET['id'], $_POST['id'], and 0.
    $id = $_GET['id'] ?? $_POST['id'] ?? 0;
