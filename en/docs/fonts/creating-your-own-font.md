## Icomoon
The **[Icomoon App][1]** is a web based tool that's especially useful for creating custom icon fonts on a per project basis.

The Icomoon App allows you to do each of the following :

 - Get one or more icons from several popular icon fonts
 - Upload other fonts, which may be icon fonts but also regular fonts
 - Upload SVG files to use as icons
 - Combine any number of icons from any number of available fonts
 - Set the UNICODE hex value for whichever characters you need
 - Export and/or save the font set you create
