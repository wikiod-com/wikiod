A nice introduction to material and textures. 

Diffuse, Bump, Specular, and Transparent Textures.

## Creating a Model Earth
Textures for this example are available at: http://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html

**Installation or Setup**

You can install three via npm

    npm install three

Or add it as a script to your HTML page

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r85/three.min.js" />

**HTML:**

    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset=utf-8>
        <title>Earth Model</title>
        <style>
            body { margin: 0; }
            canvas { width: 100%; height: 100% }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r83/three.js" />
        <script>
            // Our Javascript will go here.
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>

**Creating the scene**

To actually be able to display anything with three.js, we need three things: A scene, a camera, and a renderer. We will render the scene with the camera.

    var scene = new THREE.Scene();
    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000 );
    
    var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
    renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
    document.body.appendChild( renderer.domElement );

**Creating the Sphere**

 - Create geometry for the sphere
 - Create a phong material
 - Create a 3D Object
 - Add it to the scene

[![Plain Sphere][1]][1]

    var geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
    var material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial();
    var earthmesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);


**Add a Diffuse Texture**

The diffuse texture set the main color of the surface. 
When we apply it to a sphere, we get the following image.

[![Result][3]][3]

    material.map    = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('images/earthmap1k.jpg');
**Adding a Bump Map Texture**

 - Each of its pixels acts as a height on the surface.
 - The mountains appear more clearly thanks to their shadow.
 - It is possible to change how much the map affects lighting with
   bumpScale parameter.
 - No extra vertices are created or needed to use a bump map (unlike a displacement map)

[![Bump Texture][4]][4]

[![Result][5]][5]

    material.bumpMap   = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('images/earthbump1k.jpg');     
    material.bumpScale = 0.05;

**Adding a Specular Texture**

 - Changes the 'shininess' of an object with a texture.
 - Each pixel determines the intensity of specularity.
 - In this case, only the sea is specular because water reflects light
   more than earth.
 - You can control the specular color with the specular parameter.

    [![Specular Texture][6]][6]

[![Result][7]][7]



    material.specularMap = THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture('images/earthspec1k.jpg')
    material.specular  = new THREE.Color('grey')

**Adding a Cloud Layer**

 - We create `canvasCloud` with a canvas, and use it as a texture.
 - We do this because jpg doesnâ€™t handle an alpha channel. (However, a PNG image does)
 - We need to make the code to build the texture based on the following images.

[![Cloud Map][8]][8]

[![Cloud Map Trans][9]][9]

[![enter image description here][10]][10]

    var geometry   = new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.51, 32, 32)
    var material  = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({
      map         : new THREE.Texture(canvasCloud),
      side        : THREE.DoubleSide,
      opacity     : 0.8,
      transparent : true,
      depthWrite  : false,
    });
    var cloudMesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
    earthMesh.add(cloudMesh)

 - We attach the `cloudMesh` to `earthMesh` so they will move
   together.
 - We disable `depthWrite` and set `transparent: true` to tell three.js the cloudmesh is transparent.
 - We set sides to `THREE.DoubleSide` so both sides will be visible.
   - This avoids creating artifacts on the edge of the earth.
 - Finally, we set `opacity: 0.8` to make the clouds more translucent

**Adding Rotational Movement**

In your render loop, you simply increase the rotation

As a final touch, we will animate the cloud layer in order to make it look more realistic.

    updateFcts.push(function(delta, now) {
        cloudMesh.rotation.y += 1 / 8 * delta;
        earthMesh.rotation.y += 1 / 16 * delta;
      })
