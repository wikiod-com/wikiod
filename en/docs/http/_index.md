[Hypertext Transfer Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http) (HTTP) uses a client-request/server-response model. HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means it does not require the server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. However, for performance reasons and to avoid TCP' connection-latency issues, techniques like Persistent, Parallel or Pipelined connections may be used.
