An `.htaccess` file controls how Apache interacts with your site. When an `.htaccess` file is placed in your domainâ€™s directory (usually root directory), the file is detected and executed by Apache.

An `.htaccess` file is commonly used for the following:

 - Denying specific IPs to your site
 - Password protecting your site
 - Rewriting URLs
 - Custom error pages
 - Compressing and Caching Files
 - General Security and Hack Prevention
