[Service Fabric][1] is a distributed systems platform that provides features to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices. Service Fabric also addresses the significant challenges in developing and managing cloud applications. Developers and administrators can avoid solving complex infrastructure problems and focus instead on implementing mission-critical, demanding workloads knowing that they are scalable, reliable, and manageable. Service Fabric represents the next-generation middleware platform for building and managing these enterprise-class, Tier-1 cloud-scale applications.

You can create Service Fabric clusters in many environments, including Azure or on premises, on [Windows Server or on Linux][2]. In addition, the development environment in the SDK is identical to the production environment with no emulators involved. In other words, if it runs on your local development cluster it deploys to the same cluster in other environments.
