[Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is minimalistic, lightweight and embeddable scripting language.  It's being designed, implemented, and maintained by a [team](https://www.lua.org/authors.html) at [PUC-Rio](http://www.puc-rio.br/), the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The [mailing list](https://www.lua.org/lua-l.html) is open to get involved.

Common use-cases for Lua includes scripting video games, extending applications with plugins and configs, wrapping some high-level business logic or just embedding into devices like TVs, cars, etc.

For high performance tasks there is independent implementation using just-in-time-compiler available called [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/).
