## Syntax
 - class BeetleGuy implements Climbs, Bulletproof { }
 - applyMixins (BeetleGuy, [Climbs, Bulletproof]);

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| derivedCtor | The class that you want to use as the composition class |
| baseCtors | An array of classes to be added to the composition class |

There are three rules to bear in mind with mixins:

 - You use the `implements` keyword, not the `extends` keyword when you write your composition class
 - You need to have a matching signature to keep the compiler quiet (but it doesn’t need any real implementation – it will get that from the mixin).
 - You need to call `applyMixins` with the correct arguments.


## Example of Mixins
To create mixins, simply declare lightweight classes that can be used as "behaviours".

    class Flies {
        fly() {
            alert('Is it a bird? Is it a plane?');
        }
    }
    
    class Climbs {
        climb() {
            alert('My spider-sense is tingling.');
        }
    }
    
    class Bulletproof {
        deflect() {
            alert('My wings are a shield of steel.');
        }
    }

You can then apply these behaviours to a composition class:

    class BeetleGuy implements Climbs, Bulletproof {
            climb: () => void;
            deflect: () => void;
    }
    applyMixins (BeetleGuy, [Climbs, Bulletproof]);

The `applyMixins` function is needed to do the work of composition.

    function applyMixins(derivedCtor: any, baseCtors: any[]) {
        baseCtors.forEach(baseCtor => {
            Object.getOwnPropertyNames(baseCtor.prototype).forEach(name => {
                 if (name !== 'constructor') {
                    derivedCtor.prototype[name] = baseCtor.prototype[name];
                }
            });
        });
    }
