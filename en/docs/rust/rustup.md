**`rustup`** manages your rust installation and lets you install different versions, which can be configured and swapped easily.

## Setting up
Install the toolchain with

<!-- language: sh -->

    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

You should have the latest stable version of rust already. You can check that by typing

<!-- language: sh -->

    rustc --version

If you want to update, just run

<!-- language: sh -->

    rustup update
