Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework used to create websites that are created using a mobile-first paradigm as well as responsive web design (RWD). It uses a combination of premade CSS classes and JavaScript to make a variety of things on the web. It includes things such as a custom, responsive grid that allows websites to be viewed in on any screen, a dropdown navbar that is capable of being responsive and even simple things that can be time intensive such as premade buttons, forms and accordions to name a few.  

Bootstrap can be useful for the following reasons:

1. **Time savings**: Bootstrap features many things that are pre-built, and simply need to be called upon, when writing code. This saves a considerable amount of time, and can greatly reduce the time needed to code a website.

2. **Built with responsive web design in mind**: Bootstrap allows web developers to not be concerned about  creating things that will scale with the size of their screen, as Bootstrap uses mobile-first, responsive design that allows them to build things that will work on any screen size.

3. **Simplifies design process**: Bootstrap comes prebuilt with elements that have good design practices. This can be useful for those whose web design skills are not that great, or for those who view design as a tedious task, as many of Bootstrap classes are aesthetically pleasing and great to look at.
