## Basic HTML usage
The print elements of Bootstrap allow you to designate which items should be visible when printed and which should be hidden.

To make something visible use either of the following depending on the element and how it should appear when printed:

    .visible-print-block
    .visible-print-inline
    .visible-print-inline-block

To hide something from being printed, use the following:

    .hidden-print
