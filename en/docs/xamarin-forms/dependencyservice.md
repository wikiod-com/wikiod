When using `DependencyService` you typically need 3 parts:

* **Interface** - This defines the functions you wish to abstract.
* **Platform implementation** - A class within each platform specific project that implements the previously defined interface.
* **Registration** - Each platform specific implementation class has to be registered with the `DependencyService` through a metadata attribute. This enables the `DependencyService` to find your implementation at run time.

When using `DependencyService` you are required to provide an implementation for each platform you target. When an implementation is not provided the application will fail at run time.

## Android implementation
The Android specific implementation is a bit more complex because it forces you to inherit from a native `Java.Lang.Object` and forces you to implement the `IOnInitListener` interface. Android requires you to provide a valid Android context for a lot of the SDK methods it exposes. Xamarin.Forms exposes a `Forms.Context` object that provides you with a Android context that you can use in such cases.

    using Android.Speech.Tts;
    using Xamarin.Forms;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using DependencyServiceSample.Droid;
    
    public class TextToSpeechAndroid : Java.Lang.Object, ITextToSpeech, TextToSpeech.IOnInitListener
    {
        TextToSpeech _speaker;
    
        public TextToSpeechAndroid () {}
    
        public void Speak (string whatToSay)
        {
            var ctx = Forms.Context;

            if (_speaker == null) 
            {
                _speaker = new TextToSpeech (ctx, this);
            } 
            else 
            {
                var p = new Dictionary<string,string> ();
                _speaker.Speak (whatToSay, QueueMode.Flush, p);
            }
        }
    
        #region IOnInitListener implementation
        
        public void OnInit (OperationResult status)
        {
            if (status.Equals (OperationResult.Success)) 
            {
                var p = new Dictionary<string,string> ();
                _speaker.Speak (toSpeak, QueueMode.Flush, p);
            }
        }
        
        #endregion
    }
    
When you've created your class you need to enable the `DependencyService` to discover it at run time. This is done by adding an `[assembly]` attribute above the class definition and outside of any namespace definitions.

    using Android.Speech.Tts;
    using Xamarin.Forms;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using DependencyServiceSample.Droid;
    
    
    [assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency (typeof (TextToSpeechAndroid))]
    namespace DependencyServiceSample.Droid {
        ...
    
This attribute registers the class with the `DependencyService` so it can be used when an instance of the `ITextToSpeech` interface is needed.

## Interface
The interface defines the behaviour that you want to expose through the `DependencyService`. One example usage of a `DependencyService` is a Text-To-Speech service. There is currently no abstraction for this feature in Xamarin.Forms, so you need to create your own. Start off by defining an interface for the behaviour:

    public interface ITextToSpeech
    {
           void Speak (string whatToSay);
    }

Because we define our interface we can code against it from our shared code.

**Note:** Classes that implement the interface need to have a parameterless constructor to work with the `DependencyService`.

## iOS implementation
The interface you defined needs to be implemented in every targeted platform. For iOS this is done through the `AVFoundation` framework. The following implementation of the `ITextToSpeech` interface handles speaking a given text in English.

    using AVFoundation;
    
    public class TextToSpeechiOS : ITextToSpeech
    {
        public TextToSpeechiOS () {}
    
        public void Speak (string whatToSay)
        {
            var speechSynthesizer = new AVSpeechSynthesizer ();
    
            var speechUtterance = new AVSpeechUtterance (whatToSay) {
                Rate = AVSpeechUtterance.MaximumSpeechRate/4,
                Voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.FromLanguage ("en-US"),
                Volume = 0.5f,
                PitchMultiplier = 1.0f
            };
    
            speechSynthesizer.SpeakUtterance (speechUtterance);
        }
    }
    
When you've created your class you need to enable the `DependencyService` to discover it at run time. This is done by adding an `[assembly]` attribute above the class definition and outside of any namespace definitions.

    using AVFoundation;
    using DependencyServiceSample.iOS;
    
    [assembly: Xamarin.Forms.Dependency (typeof (TextToSpeechiOS))]
    namespace DependencyServiceSample.iOS {
        public class TextToSpeechiOS : ITextToSpeech
    ...
    
This attribute registers the class with the `DependencyService` so it can be used when an instance of the `ITextToSpeech` interface is needed.

## Shared code
After you've created and registered your platform-specific classes you can start hooking them up to your shared code. The following page contains a button that triggers the text-to-speech functionality using a pre-defined sentence. It uses `DependencyService` to retrieve a platform-specific implementation of `ITextToSpeech` at run time using the native SDKs.

    public MainPage ()
    {
        var speakButton = new Button {
            Text = "Talk to me baby!",
            VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.CenterAndExpand,
            HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.CenterAndExpand,
        };
        
        speakButton.Clicked += (sender, e) => {
            DependencyService.Get<ITextToSpeech>().Speak("Xamarin Forms likes eating cake by the ocean.");
        };
        
        Content = speakButton;
    }
    
When you run this application on an iOS or Android device and tap the button you will hear the application speak the given sentence.
