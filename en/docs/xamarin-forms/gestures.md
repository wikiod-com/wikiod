## Make an Image tappable by adding a TapGestureRecognizer
There are a couple of default recognizers available in Xamarin.Forms, one of them is the `TapGestureRecognizer`.

You can add them to virtually any visual element. Have a look at a simple implementation which binds to an `Image`. Here is how to do it in code.

    var tappedCommand = new Command(() =>
    {
        //handle the tap
    });

    var tapGestureRecognizer = new TapGestureRecognizer { Command = tappedCommand };
    image.GestureRecognizers.Add(tapGestureRecognizer);

Or in XAML:

    <Image Source="tapped.jpg">
        <Image.GestureRecognizers>
            <TapGestureRecognizer
                    Command="{Binding TappedCommand}"
                    NumberOfTapsRequired="2" />
      </Image.GestureRecognizers>
    </Image>

Here the command is set by using data binding. 
As you can see you can also set the `NumberOfTapsRequired` to enable it for more taps before it takes action. The default value is 1 tap. 

Other gestures are Pinch and Pan.

## Zoom an Image with the Pinch gesture
In order to make an `Image` (or any other visual element) zoomable we have to add a `PinchGestureRecognizer` to it. Here is how to do it in code: 

    var pinchGesture = new PinchGestureRecognizer();
    pinchGesture.PinchUpdated += (s, e) => {
    // Handle the pinch
    };
        
    image.GestureRecognizers.Add(pinchGesture);

But it can also be done from XAML:

    <Image Source="waterfront.jpg">
      <Image.GestureRecognizers>
        <PinchGestureRecognizer PinchUpdated="OnPinchUpdated" />
      </Image.GestureRecognizers>
    </Image>

In the accompanied event handler you should provide the code to zoom your image. Of course other uses can be implement as well.

    void OnPinchUpdated (object sender, PinchGestureUpdatedEventArgs e)
    {
        // ... code here
    }

Other gestures are Tap and Pan.

## Show all of the zoomed Image content with the PanGestureRecognizer
When you have a zoomed `Image` (or other content) you may want to drag around the `Image` to show all of its content in the zoomed in state.

This can be achieved by implementing the PanGestureRecognizer.
From code this looks like so:

    var panGesture = new PanGestureRecognizer();
    panGesture.PanUpdated += (s, e) => {
      // Handle the pan
    };
    
    image.GestureRecognizers.Add(panGesture);

This can also be done from XAML:

    <Image Source="MonoMonkey.jpg">
      <Image.GestureRecognizers>
        <PanGestureRecognizer PanUpdated="OnPanUpdated" />
      </Image.GestureRecognizers>
    </Image>

In the code-behind event you can now handle the panning accordingly. Use this method signature to handle it:

    void OnPanUpdated (object sender, PanUpdatedEventArgs e)
    {
      // Handle the pan
    }

## Place a pin where the user touched the screen with MR.Gestures
Xamarins built in gesture recognizers provide only very basic touch handling. E.g. there is no way to get the position of a touching finger.
MR.Gestures is a component which adds 14 different touch handling events. The position of the touching fingers is part of the `EventArgs` passed to all MR.Gestures events.

If you want to place a pin anywhere on the screen, the easiest way is to use an `MR.Gestures.AbsoluteLayout` which handles the `Tapping` event.

    <mr:AbsoluteLayout x:Name="MainLayout" Tapping="OnTapping">
        ...
    </mr:AbsoluteLayout>

As you can see the `Tapping="OnTapping"` also feels more like .NET than Xamarins syntax with the nested `GestureRecognizers`. That syntax was copied from iOS and it smells a bit for .NET developers.

In your code behind you could add the `OnTapping` handler like this:

    private void OnTapping(object sender, MR.Gestures.TapEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Touches?.Length > 0)
        {
            Point touch = e.Touches[0];
            var image = new Image() { Source = "pin" };
            MainLayout.Children.Add(image, touch);
        }
    }

Instead of the `Tapping` event, you could also use the `TappingCommand` and bind to your ViewModel, but that would complicate things in this simple example.

More samples for MR.Gestures can be found in the [GestureSample app on GitHub][1] and on the [MR.Gestures website][2]. These also show how to use all the other touch events with event handlers, commands, MVVM, ...
