## AWS Simple Notification Service Lingo:

**Endpoint** - The endpoint can be a phone, email address or whatever, it's what AWS SNS can hit back with a notification
  
**Topic** - Essentially a group that contains all of your endpoints

**Subscribe** - You sign up your phone/client to receive notifcations

   
## Generic Push Notification Lingo:
**APNS** - Apple Push Notification Service. Apple is the only one who can send push notifications. This is why we provision our app with the proper certificate. We provide AWS SNS the certificate that Apple provides us to authorize SNS to send a notification to APNS on our behalf. 


**GCM** - Google Cloud Messaging is very similar to APNS. Google is the only one who can directly send push notifications. So we first register our App in GCM and hand over our token to AWS SNS. SNS handles all the complex stuff dealing with GCM and sending over the data.



## iOS Example
 1. You will need a development device
 2. Go to your Apple Developer Account and create a provisioning profile with Push Notifications enabled
 3. You will need some sort of way to notify your phone (AWS, Azure..etc) **We will use AWS here**
