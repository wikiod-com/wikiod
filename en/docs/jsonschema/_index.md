# What is JSON Schema?

[JSON Schema][1] is a vocabulary that allows you to validate, annotate, and manipulate JSON documents.

A JSON Schema is itself a [JSON document][2] and requires a third party library to validate data against it.

It is currently a draft IETF standard allowing consistent expectation from implementations based on the standard specification.

# Vocabularies

## [Published vocabularies][3]
 - [JSON Schema Core][4] the basic foundation of JSON Schema
 - [JSON Schema Validation][5] the validation keywords of JSON Schema
 - [JSON Hyper-Schema][6] the hyper-media keywords of JSON Schema

## [Proposed vocabularies][7] requiring discussion, feedback and review
 - [JSON Schema API][8] API documentation keyword proposal
 - [JSON Schema UI][9] the UI keywords for consistent UI generation proposal

# Implementations

A list of [implementations][10] is maintained in the [GitHub repository][3]. The list of supported languages currently lists validators for:

> ActionScript 3, C, C++, Clojure, Dart, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, .NET, PHP, Perl, Python and Ruby

There are also UI generators, data parsers, schema editors, documentation generators and IDE support.
