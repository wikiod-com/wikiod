**Apache Spark** is an open source big data processing framework built around speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics. A developer should use it when (s)he handles large amount of data, which usually imply memory limitations and/or prohibitive processing time.

It should also mention any large subjects within apache-spark, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for apache-spark is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
