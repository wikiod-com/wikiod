When WPF application launched, it could take a while for a current language runtime (CLR) to initialize .NET Framework. As a result, first application window can appear some time after application was launched, depending of application complexity.

Splash screen in WPF allows application to show either static image or custom dynamic content during initialization before first window appears.


## Adding simple Splash Screen
Follow this steps for adding splash screen into WPF application in Visual Studio:
1. Create or get any image and add it to your project (e.g. inside _Images_ folder):

2. Open properties window for this image (**View â†’ Properties Window**) and change **Build Action** setting to **SplashScreen** value:

3. Run the application. You'll see your splash screen image on the center of the screen before application window appears (after window appears, splash screen image will faded out within about 300 milliseconds).

## Testing Splash Screen
If your application is lightweight and simple, it will launch very fast, and with similar speed will appear and disappear splash screen.

As soon as splash screen disappearing after `Application.Startup` method completed, you can simulate application launch delay by following this steps:
1. Open **App.xaml.cs** file
2. Add _using_ namespace `using System.Threading;`
3. Override `OnStartup` method and add `Thread.Sleep(3000);` inside it:

Code should look like:

    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Configuration;
    using System.Data;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Threading;
    using System.Windows;

    namespace WpfApplication1
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Interaction logic for App.xaml
        /// </summary>
        public partial class App : Application
        {
            protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)
            {
                base.OnStartup(e);

                Thread.Sleep(3000);
            }
        }
    }

4. Run the application. Now it will be launch for about 3 seconds longer, so you'll have more time to test your splash screen.

## Creating splash screen window with progress reporting
_WPF_ does not support displaying anything other than an image as a splash screen out-of-the-box, so we'll need to create a `Window` which will serve as a splash screen. We're assuming that we've already created a project containing `MainWindow` class, which is to be the application main window.

First off we add a `SplashScreenWindow` window to our project:

    <Window x:Class="SplashScreenExample.SplashScreenWindow"
            xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
            xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
            WindowStartupLocation="CenterScreen"
            WindowStyle="None"
            AllowsTransparency="True"
            Height="30"
            Width="200">
        <Grid>
            <ProgressBar x:Name="progressBar" />
            <TextBlock HorizontalAlignment="Center"
                       VerticalAlignment="Center">Loading...</TextBlock>
        </Grid>
    </Window>

Then we expose a property on the `SplashScreenWindow` class so that we can easily update the current progress value (**_SplashScreenWindow.xaml.cs_**):

    public partial class SplashScreenWindow : Window
    {
        public SplashScreenWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        public double Progress
        {
            get { return progressBar.Value; }
            set { progressBar.Value = value; }
        }
    }

Next we override the `Application.OnStartup` method to show the splash screen, do some work and finally show the main window (**_App.xaml.cs_**):

    public partial class App : Application
    {
        protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)
        {
            base.OnStartup(e);

            //initialize the splash screen and set it as the application main window
            var splashScreen = new SplashScreenWindow();
            this.MainWindow = splashScreen;
            splashScreen.Show();

            //in order to ensure the UI stays responsive, we need to
            //do the work on a different thread
            Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
            {
                //we need to do the work in batches so that we can report progress
                for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
                {
                    //simulate a part of work being done
                    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(30);

                    //because we're not on the UI thread, we need to use the Dispatcher
                    //associated with the splash screen to update the progress bar
                    splashScreen.Dispatcher.Invoke(() => splashScreen.Progress = i);
                }

                //once we're done we need to use the Dispatcher
                //to create and show the main window
                this.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =>
                {
                    //initialize the main window, set it as the application main window
                    //and close the splash screen
                    var mainWindow = new MainWindow();
                    this.MainWindow = mainWindow;
                    mainWindow.Show();
                    splashScreen.Close();
                });
            });
        }
    }


Lastly we need to take care of the default mechanism which shows the `MainWindow` on application startup. All we need to do is to remove the `StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml"` attribute from the root `Application` tag in **_App.xaml_** file.

## Creating custom splash screen window
_WPF_ does not support displaying anything other than an image as a splash screen out-of-the-box, so we'll need to create a `Window` which will serve as a splash screen. We're assuming that we've already created a project containing `MainWindow` class, which is to be the application main window.

First off we add a `SplashScreenWindow` window to our project:

    <Window x:Class="SplashScreenExample.SplashScreenWindow"
            xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
            xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
            WindowStartupLocation="CenterScreen"
            WindowStyle="None"
            AllowsTransparency="True"
            Height="30"
            Width="200">
        <Grid>
            <ProgressBar IsIndeterminate="True" />
            <TextBlock HorizontalAlignment="Center"
                       VerticalAlignment="Center">Loading...</TextBlock>
        </Grid>
    </Window>

Then we override the `Application.OnStartup` method to show the splash screen, do some work and finally show the main window (**_App.xaml.cs_**):

    public partial class App
    {
        protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)
        {
            base.OnStartup(e);

            //initialize the splash screen and set it as the application main window
            var splashScreen = new SplashScreenWindow();
            this.MainWindow = splashScreen;
            splashScreen.Show();

            //in order to ensure the UI stays responsive, we need to
            //do the work on a different thread
            Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
            {
                //simulate some work being done
                System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(3000);

                //since we're not on the UI thread
                //once we're done we need to use the Dispatcher
                //to create and show the main window
                this.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =>
                {
                    //initialize the main window, set it as the application main window
                    //and close the splash screen
                    var mainWindow = new MainWindow();
                    this.MainWindow = mainWindow;
                    mainWindow.Show();
                    splashScreen.Close();
                });
            });
        }
    }

Lastly we need to take care of the default mechanism which shows the `MainWindow` on application startup. All we need to do is to remove the `StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml"` attribute from the root `Application` tag in **_App.xaml_** file.
