## Global variables
To declare a single instance of a variable which is accessible in different source files, it is possible to make it in the global scope with keyword `extern`. This keyword says the compiler that somewhere in the code there is a definition for this variable, so it can be used everywhere and all write/read will be done in one place of memory.

    // File my_globals.h:
    
    #ifndef __MY_GLOBALS_H__
    #define __MY_GLOBALS_H__
    
    extern int circle_radius; // Promise to the compiler that circle_radius 
                              // will be defined somewhere
    
    #endif
    
&nbsp;

    // File foo1.cpp:
    
    #include "my_globals.h"
    
    int circle_radius = 123; // Defining the extern variable
    
&nbsp;

    // File main.cpp:
    
    #include "my_globals.h"
    #include <iostream>
    
    int main()
    {
        std::cout << "The radius is: " << circle_radius << "\n";'
        return 0;
    }
Output:

    The radius is: 123
    




## Simple block scope
The scope of a variable in a block `{ ... }`, begins after declaration and ends at the end of the block. If there is nested block, the inner block can hide the scope of a variable which is declared in the outer block.

    {
        int x = 100;
        //   ^
        //   Scope of `x` begins here
        //
    }   // <- Scope of `x` ends here

If a nested block starts within an outer block, a new declared variable with the same name which is before in the outer class, hides the first one.

    {
        int x = 100;
    
        {
            int x = 200;
    
            std::cout << x;  // <- Output is 200
        }
    
        std::cout << x;  // <- Output is 100
    }
