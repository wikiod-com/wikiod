Unions are very useful tools, but come with a few important caveats:

 - It is undefined behavior, per the C++ standard, to access an element of a union that was not the most recently modified member. Although a lot of C++ compilers permit this access in well defined ways, these are extensions and cannot be guaranteed across compilers.

   A [`std::variant`][1] (since C++17) is like a union, only it tells you what it currently contains (part of its visible state is the type of the value it holds at a
given moment: it enforces value access happening only to that type). 
 - Implementations do not necessarily align members of different sizes to the same address.

## Undefined Behavior
    union U {
        int a;
        short b;
        float c;
    };
    U u;

    u.a = 10;
    if (u.b == 10) {
       // this is undefined behavior since 'a' was the last member to be
       // written to. A lot of compilers will allow this and might issue a
       // warning, but the result will be "as expected"; this is a compiler
       // extension and cannot be guaranteed across compilers (i.e. this is
       // not compliant/portable code).
    }


## Basic Union Features
Unions are a specialized struct within which all members occupy overlapping memory.

    union U {
        int a;
        short b;
        float c;
    };
    U u;

    //Address of a and b will be equal
    (void*)&u.a == (void*)&u.b;
    (void*)&u.a == (void*)&u.c;

    //Assigning to any union member changes the shared memory of all members
    u.c = 4.f;
    u.a = 5;
    u.c != 4.f;

## Typical Use
Unions are useful for minimizing memory usage for exclusive data, such as when implementing mixed data types.

    struct AnyType {
        enum {
            IS_INT,
            IS_FLOAT
        } type;
        
        union Data {
            int as_int;
            float as_float;
        } value;

        AnyType(int i) : type(IS_INT) { value.as_int = i; }
        AnyType(float f) : type(IS_FLOAT) { value.as_float = f; }

        int get_int() const {
            if(type == IS_INT)
                return value.as_int;
            else
                return (int)value.as_float;
        }
        
        float get_float() const {
            if(type == IS_FLOAT)
                return value.as_float;
            else
                return (float)value.as_int;
        }
    };
