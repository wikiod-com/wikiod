A pattern in which a class inherits from a class template with itself as one of its template parameters. CRTP is usually used to provide *static polymorphism* in C++.

## The Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP)
CRTP is a powerful, static alternative to virtual functions and traditional inheritance that can be used to give types properties at compile time. It works by having a base class template which takes, as one of its template parameters, the derived class. This permits it to legally perform a `static_cast` of its `this` pointer to the derived class.

Of course, this also means that a CRTP class must *always* be used as the base class of some other class. And the derived class must pass itself to the base class.

Let's say you have a set of containers that all support the functions `begin()` and `end()`. The standard library's requirements for containers require more functionality. We can design a CRTP base class that provides that functionality, based solely on `begin()` and `end()`:

    #include <iterator>
    template <typename Sub>
    class Container {
      private:
        // self() yields a reference to the derived type
        Sub& self() { return *static_cast<Sub*>(this); }
        Sub const& self() const { return *static_cast<Sub const*>(this); }
    
      public:
        decltype(auto) front() {
          return *self().begin();
        }
    
        decltype(auto) back() {
          return *std::prev(self().end());
        }
    
        decltype(auto) size() const {
          return std::distance(self().begin(), self().end());
        }
    
        decltype(auto) operator[](std::size_t i) {
          return *std::next(self().begin(), i);
        }
    };

The above class provides the functions `front()`, `back()`, `size()`, and `operator[]` for any subclass which provides `begin()` and `end()`. An example subclass is a simple dynamically allocated array:

    #include <memory>
    // A dynamically allocated array
    template <typename T>
    class DynArray : public Container<DynArray<T>> {
      public:
        using Base = Container<DynArray<T>>;

        DynArray(std::size_t size)
          : size_{size},
          data_{std::make_unique<T[]>(size_)}
        { }
    
        T* begin() { return data_.get(); }
        const T* begin() const { return data_.get(); }
        T* end() { return data_.get() + size_; }
        const T* end() const { return data_.get() + size_; }
    
      private:
        std::size_t size_;
        std::unique_ptr<T[]> data_;
    };

Users of the `DynArray` class can use the interfaces provided by the CRTP base class easily as follows:

    DynArray<int> arr(10);
    arr.front() = 2;
    arr[2] = 5;
    assert(arr.size() == 10);

**Usefulness:**
This pattern particularly avoids virtual function calls at run-time which occur to traverse down the inheritance hierarchy and simply relies on static casts:

    DynArray<int> arr(10);
    DynArray<int>::Base & base = arr;
    base.begin(); // no virtual calls

The only static cast inside the function `begin()` in the base class `Container<DynArray<int>>` allows the compiler to drastically optimize the code and no virtual table look up happens at runtime.

**Limitations:**
Because the base class is templated and different for two different `DynArray`s
it is not possible to store pointers to their base classes in an type-homogenous array as one could generally do with normal inheritance where the base class is not dependent on the derived type:

    class A {};
    class B: public A{};
    
    A* a = new B;
    
<!-- end version if -->

## CRTP to avoid code duplication
The example in [Visitor Pattern](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%2b%2b/4335/design-pattern-implementation-in-c/15127/visitor-pattern#t=201607291405391540231) provides a compelling use-case for CRTP:

    struct IShape
    {
        virtual ~IShape() = default;
    
        virtual void accept(IShapeVisitor&) const = 0;
    };

    struct Circle : IShape
    {
        // ...        
        // Each shape has to implement this method the same way
        void accept(IShapeVisitor& visitor) const override { visitor.visit(*this); }
        // ...
    };
    
    struct Square : IShape
    {
        // ...    
        // Each shape has to implement this method the same way
        void accept(IShapeVisitor& visitor) const override { visitor.visit(*this); }
        // ...
    };

Each child type of `IShape` needs to implement the same function the same way. That's a lot of extra typing. Instead, we can introduce a new type in the hierarchy that does this for us:

    template <class Derived>
    struct IShapeAcceptor : IShape {
        void accept(IShapeVisitor& visitor) const override {
            // visit with our exact type
            visitor.visit(*static_cast<Derived const*>(this));
        }
    };

And now, each shape simply needs to inherit from the acceptor:

    struct Circle : IShapeAcceptor<Circle>
    {
        Circle(const Point& center, double radius) : center(center), radius(radius) {}
        Point center;
        double radius;
    };

    struct Square : IShapeAcceptor<Square>
    {
        Square(const Point& topLeft, double sideLength) : topLeft(topLeft), sideLength(sideLength) {}    
        Point topLeft;
        double sideLength;
    };

No duplicate code necessary.
