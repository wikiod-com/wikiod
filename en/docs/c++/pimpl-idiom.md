The **pimpl idiom** (**p**ointer to **impl**ementation, sometimes referred to as  *opaque pointer* or *cheshire cat technique*), reduces the compilation times of a class by moving all its private data members into a struct defined in the .cpp file.

The class owns a pointer to the implementation. This way, it can be forward declared, so that the header file does not need to `#include` classes that are used in private member variables.

When using the pimpl idiom, changing a private data member does not require recompiling classes that depend on it.

## Basic Pimpl idiom
<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
In the header file:

    // widget.h

    #include <memory>  // std::unique_ptr
    #include <experimental/propagate_const>
    
    class Widget
    {
        public:
            Widget();
            ~Widget();
            void DoSomething();

        private:
            // the pImpl idiom is named after the typical variable name used
            // ie, pImpl:
            struct Impl;                    // forward declaration
            std::experimental::propagate_const<std::unique_ptr< Impl >> pImpl;  // ptr to actual implementation
    };

In the implementation file:

    // widget.cpp

    #include "widget.h"
    #include "reallycomplextype.h" // no need to include this header inside widget.h

    struct Widget::Impl
    {
        // the attributes needed from Widget go here
        ReallyComplexType rct;
    };

    Widget::Widget() :
        pImpl(std::make_unique<Impl>())
    {}

    Widget::~Widget() = default;

    void Widget::DoSomething()
    {
        // do the stuff here with pImpl
    }
<!-- end version if -->
The `pImpl` contains the `Widget` state (or some/most of it).  Instead of the `Widget` description of state being exposed in the header file, it can be only exposed within the implementation.

`pImpl` stands for "pointer to implementation".  The "real" implementation of `Widget` is in the `pImpl`.

Danger: Note that for this to work with `unique_ptr`, `~Widget()` must be implemented at a point in a file where the `Impl` is fully visible.  You can `=default` it there, but if `=default` where `Impl` is undefined, the program may easily become ill-formed, no diagnostic required.
