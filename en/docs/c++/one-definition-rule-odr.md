## Multiply defined function
The most important consequence of the One Definition Rule is that non-inline functions with external linkage should only be defined once in a program, although they can be declared multiple times. Therefore, such functions should not be defined in headers, since a header can be included multiple times from different translation units.

`foo.h`:

    #ifndef FOO_H
    #define FOO_H
    #include <iostream>
    void foo() { std::cout << "foo"; }
    void bar();
    #endif

`foo.cpp`:

    #include "foo.h"
    void bar() { std:: cout << "bar"; }

`main.cpp`:

    #include "foo.h"
    int main() {
        foo();
        bar();
    }

In this program, the function `foo` is defined in the header `foo.h`, which is included twice: once from `foo.cpp` and once from `main.cpp`. Each translation unit therefore contains its own definition of `foo`. Note that the include guards in `foo.h` do not prevent this from happening, since `foo.cpp` and `main.cpp` both *separately* include `foo.h`. The most likely result of trying to build this program is a link-time error identifying `foo` as having been multiply defined.

To avoid such errors, one should *declare* functions in headers and *define* them in the corresponding `.cpp` files, with some exceptions (see other examples). 

## Inline functions
A function declared `inline` may be defined in multiple translation units, provided that all definitions are identical. It also must be defined in every translation unit in which it is used. Therefore, inline functions *should* be defined in headers and there is no need to mention them in the implementation file.

The program will behave as though there is a single definition of the function.

`foo.h`:

    #ifndef FOO_H
    #define FOO_H
    #include <iostream>
    inline void foo() { std::cout << "foo"; }
    void bar();
    #endif

`foo.cpp`:

    #include "foo.h"
    void bar() {
        // more complicated definition
    }

`main.cpp`:

    #include "foo.h"
    int main() {
        foo();
        bar();
    }

In this example, the simpler function `foo` is defined inline in the header file while the more complicated function `bar` is not inline and is defined in the implementation file. Both the `foo.cpp` and `main.cpp` translation units contain definitions of `foo`, but this program is well-formed since `foo` is inline.

A function defined within a class definition (which may be a member function or a friend function) is *implicitly* inline. Therefore, if a class is defined in a header, member functions of the class may be defined within the class definition, even though the definitions may be included in multiple translation units:

    // in foo.h
    class Foo {
        void bar() { std::cout << "bar"; }
        void baz();
    };

    // in foo.cpp
    void Foo::baz() {
       // definition
    }

The function `Foo::baz` is defined out-of-line, so it is *not* an inline function, and must not be defined in the header.

## ODR violation via overload resolution
Even with identical tokens for inline functions, ODR can be violated if lookup of names doesn't refer to the same entity. let's consider `func` in following:

- header.h

      void overloaded(int);
      inline void func() { overloaded('*'); }

- foo.cpp

      #include "header.h"

      void foo()
      {
          func(); // `overloaded` refers to `void overloaded(int)`
      }

- bar.cpp

      void overloaded(char); // can come from other include
      #include "header.h"

      void bar()
      {
          func(); // `overloaded` refers to `void overloaded(char)`
      }

We have an ODR violation as `overloaded` refers to different entities depending of the translation unit.
