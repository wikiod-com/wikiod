## Measuring time using <chrono>
The `system_clock` can be used to measure the time elapsed during some part of a program's execution.
<!-- if version [eq c++11] -->
    #include <iostream>
    #include <chrono>
    #include <thread>
    
    int main() {
        auto start = std::chrono::system_clock::now(); // This and "end"'s type is std::chrono::time_point
        { // The code to test
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
        }
        auto end = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    
        std::chrono::duration<double> elapsed = end - start;
        std::cout << "Elapsed time: " << elapsed.count() << "s";
    }
<!-- end version if -->
In this example, `sleep_for` was used to make the active thread sleep for a time period measured in `std::chrono::seconds`, but the code between braces could be any function call that takes some time to execute.

## Find number of days between two dates
This example shows how to find number of days between two dates. A date is specified by year/month/day of month, and additionally hour/minute/second. 

Program calculates number of days in years since 2000.


    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    #include <chrono>
    #include <ctime>
    
    /***
     * Creates a std::tm structure from raw date.
     * 
     * \param year (must be 1900 or greater)
     * \param month months since January – [1, 12] 
     * \param day day of the month – [1, 31] 
     * \param minutes minutes after the hour – [0, 59] 
     * \param seconds seconds after the minute – [0, 61](until C++11) / [0, 60] (since C++11)
     * 
     * Based on http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/c/tm

        tm_ret.tm_min = minutes;

        return diff_in_days.count();
    }
    
    int main()
    {
        for ( int year = 2000; year <= 2016; ++year ) 
            std::cout << "There are " << get_days_in_year(year) << " days in " << year << "\n";
