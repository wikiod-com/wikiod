## Syntax
 - std::atomic\<T\>
 - std::atomic_flag

`std::atomic` allows atomic access to a TriviallyCopyable type, it is implementation-dependent if this is done via atomic operations or by using locks. The only guaranteed lock-free atomic type is `std::atomic_flag`.

## Multi-threaded Access
An atomic type can be used to safely read and write to a memory location shared between two threads.

A Bad example that is likely to cause a data race:

    #include <thread>
    #include <iostream>
    
    
    //function will add all values including and between 'a' and 'b' to 'result'
    void add(int a, int b, int * result) {
        for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
            *result += i;
        }
    }
    
    int main() {
        //a primitive data type has no thread safety
        int shared = 0;
    
        //create a thread that may run parallel to the 'main' thread
        //the thread will run the function 'add' defined above with paramters a = 1, b = 100, result = &shared
        //analogous to 'add(1,100, &shared);'
        std::thread addingThread(add, 1, 100, &shared);
    
        //attempt to print the value of 'shared' to console
        //main will keep repeating this until the addingThread becomes joinable
        while (!addingThread.joinable()) {
            //this may cause undefined behavior or print a corrupted value
            //if the addingThread tries to write to 'shared' while the main thread is reading it
            std::cout << shared << std::endl;  
        }
    
    
        //rejoin the thread at the end of execution for cleaning purposes
        addingThread.join();
        
        return 0;
    }

The above example may cause a corrupted read and can lead to undefined behavior.

An example with thread safety:

    #include <atomic>
    #include <thread>
    #include <iostream>
    
    
        //function will add all values including and between 'a' and 'b' to 'result'
    void add(int a, int b, std::atomic<int> * result) {
        for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
            //atomically add 'i' to result
            result->fetch_add(i);
        }
    }
    
    int main() {
        //atomic template used to store non-atomic objects
        std::atomic<int> shared = 0;
    
        //create a thread that may run parallel to the 'main' thread
        //the thread will run the function 'add' defined above with paramters a = 1, b = 100, result = &shared
        //analogous to 'add(1,100, &shared);'
        std::thread addingThread(add, 1, 10000, &shared);
    
        //print the value of 'shared' to console
        //main will keep repeating this until the addingThread becomes joinable
        while (!addingThread.joinable()) {
            //safe way to read the value of shared atomically for thread safe read
            std::cout << shared.load() << std::endl;  
        }
    
    
        //rejoin the thread at the end of execution for cleaning purposes
        addingThread.join();
        
        return 0;
    }

The above example is safe because all `store()` and `load()` operations of the `atomic` data type protect the encapsulated `int` from simultaneous access.
