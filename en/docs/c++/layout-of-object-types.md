## Class types
By "class", we mean a type that was defined using the `class` or `struct` keyword (but not `enum struct` or `enum class`).

* Even an empty class still occupies at least one byte of storage; it will therefore consist purely of padding. This ensures that if `p` points to an object of an empty class, then `p + 1` is a distinct address and points to a distinct object. However, it is possible for an empty class to have a size of 0 when used as a base class. See [empty base optimisation][1].

      class Empty_1 {};                               // sizeof(Empty_1)       == 1
      class Empty_2 {};                               // sizeof(Empty_2)       == 1
      class Derived : Empty_1 {};                     // sizeof(Derived)       == 1
      class DoubleDerived : Empty_1, Empty_2 {};      // sizeof(DoubleDerived) == 1
      class Holder { Empty_1 e; };                    // sizeof(Holder)        == 1
      class DoubleHolder { Empty_1 e1; Empty_2 e2; }; // sizeof(DoubleHolder)  == 2
      class DerivedHolder : Empty_1 { Empty_1 e; };   // sizeof(DerivedHolder) == 2

* The object representation of a class type contains the object representations of the base class and non-static member types. Therefore, for example, in the following class:

      struct S {
          int x;
          char* y;
      };

  there is a consecutive sequence of `sizeof(int)` bytes within an `S` object, called a *subobject,* that contain the value of `x`, and another subobject with `sizeof(char*)` bytes that contains the value of `y`. The two cannot be interleaved.

* If a class type has members and/or base classes with types `t1, t2,...tN`, the size must be at least `sizeof(t1) + sizeof(t2) + ... + sizeof(tN)` given the preceding points. However, depending on the [alignment](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%2b%2b/9249/alignment) requirements of the members and base classes, the compiler may be forced to insert padding between subobjects, or at the beginning or end of the complete object.

      struct AnInt      { int i; };
        // sizeof(AnInt)        == sizeof(int)
        // Assuming a typical 32- or 64-bit system, sizeof(AnInt)        == 4 (4).
      struct TwoInts    { int i, j; };
        // sizeof(TwoInts)      >= 2 * sizeof(int)
        // Assuming a typical 32- or 64-bit system, sizeof(TwoInts)      == 8 (4 + 4).
      struct IntAndChar { int i; char c; };
        // sizeof(IntAndChar)   >= sizeof(int) + sizeof(char)
        // Assuming a typical 32- or 64-bit system, sizeof(IntAndChar)   == 8 (4 + 1 + padding).
      struct AnIntDerived : AnInt { long long l; };
        // sizeof(AnIntDerived) >= sizeof(AnInt) + sizeof(long long)
        // Assuming a typical 32- or 64-bit system, sizeof(AnIntDerived) == 16 (4 + padding + 8).

* If padding is inserted in an object due to alignment requirements, the size will be greater than the sum of the sizes of the members and base classes.  With `n`-byte alignment, size will typically be the smallest multiple of `n` which is larger than the size of all members & base classes.  Each member `memN` will typically be placed at an address which is a multiple of `alignof(memN)`, and `n` will typically be the largest `alignof` out of all members' `alignof`s.  Due to this, if a member with a smaller `alignof` is followed by a member with a larger `alignof`, there is a possibility that the latter member will not be aligned properly if placed immediately after the former.  In this case, padding (also known as an _alignment member_ ) will be placed between the two members, such that the latter member can have its desired alignment.  Conversely, if a member with a larger `alignof` is followed by a member with a smaller `alignof`, no padding will usually be necessary.  This process is also known as "packing".  
Due to classes typically sharing the `alignof` of their member with the largest `alignof`, classes will typically be aligned to the `alignof` of the largest built-in type they directly or indirectly contain.  

      // Assume sizeof(short) == 2, sizeof(int) == 4, and sizeof(long long) == 8.
      // Assume 4-byte alignment is specified to the compiler.
      struct Char { char c; };
        // sizeof(Char)                == 1 (sizeof(char))
      struct Int  { int i; };
        // sizeof(Int)                 == 4 (sizeof(int))
      struct CharInt { char c; int i; };
        // sizeof(CharInt)             == 8 (1 (char) + 3 (padding) + 4 (int))
      struct ShortIntCharInt { short s; int i; char c; int j; };
        // sizeof(ShortIntCharInt)     == 16 (2 (short) + 2 (padding) + 4 (int) + 1 (char) +
        //                                    3 (padding) + 4 (int))
      struct ShortIntCharCharInt { short s; int i; char c; char d; int j; };
        // sizeof(ShortIntCharCharInt) == 16 (2 (short) + 2 (padding) + 4 (int) + 1 (char) +
        //                                    1 (char) + 2 (padding) + 4 (int))
      struct ShortCharShortInt { short s; char c; short t; int i; };
        // sizeof(ShortCharShortInt)   == 12 (2 (short) + 1 (char) + 1 (padding) + 2 (short) +
        //                                    2 (padding) + 4 (int))
      struct IntLLInt { int i; long long l; int j; };
        // sizeof(IntLLInt)            == 16 (4 (int) + 8 (long long) + 4 (int))
        // If packing isn't explicitly specified, most compilers will pack this as
        //   8-byte alignment, such that:
        // sizeof(IntLLInt)            == 24 (4 (int) + 4 (padding) + 8 (long long) +
        //                                    4 (int) + 4 (padding))

      // Assume sizeof(bool) == 1, sizeof(ShortIntCharInt) == 16, and sizeof(IntLLInt) == 24.
      // Assume default alignment: alignof(ShortIntCharInt) == 4, alignof(IntLLInt) == 8.
      struct ShortChar3ArrShortInt {
          short s;
          char c3[3];
          short t;
          int i;
      };
        // ShortChar3ArrShortInt has 4-byte alignment: alignof(int) >= alignof(char) &&
        //                                             alignof(int) >= alignof(short)
        // sizeof(ShortChar3ArrShortInt) == 12 (2 (short) + 3 (char[3]) + 1 (padding) +
        //                                      2 (short) + 4 (int))
        // Note that t is placed at alignment of 2, not 4.  alignof(short) == 2.

      struct Large_1 {
          ShortIntCharInt sici;
          bool b;
          ShortIntCharInt tjdj;
      };
        // Large_1 has 4-byte alignment.
          // alignof(ShortIntCharInt) == alignof(int) == 4
          // alignof(b) == 1
          // Therefore, alignof(Large_1) == 4.
        // sizeof(Large_1) == 36 (16 (ShortIntCharInt) + 1 (bool) + 3 (padding) +
        //                        16 (ShortIntCharInt))
      struct Large_2 {
          IntLLInt illi;
          float f;
          IntLLInt jmmj;
      };
        // Large_2 has 8-byte alignment.
          // alignof(IntLLInt) == alignof(long long) == 8
          // alignof(float) == 4
          // Therefore, alignof(Large_2) == 8.
        // sizeof(Large_2) == 56 (24 (IntLLInt) + 4 (float) + 4 (padding) + 24 (IntLLInt))

<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
* If strict alignment is forced with `alignas`, padding will be used to force the type to meet the specified alignment, even when it would otherwise be smaller. For example, with the definition below, `Chars<5>` will have three (or possibly more) padding bytes inserted at the end so that its total size is 8. It is not possible for a class with an alignment of 4 to have a size of 5 because it would be impossible to make an array of that class, so the size must be "rounded up" to a multiple of 4 by inserting padding bytes.

      // This type shall always be aligned to a multiple of 4.  Padding shall be inserted as
      // needed.
      // Chars<1>..Chars<4> are 4 bytes, Chars<5>..Chars<8> are 8 bytes, etc.
      template<size_t SZ>
      struct alignas(4) Chars { char arr[SZ]; };

      static_assert(sizeof(Chars<1>) == sizeof(Chars<4>), "Alignment is strict.\n");
<!-- end version if -->
 * If two non-static members of a class have the same [access specifier](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%2b%2b/508/classes-structures/1668/access-specifiers), then the one that comes later in declaration order is guaranteed to come later in the object representation. But if two non-static members have different access specifiers, their relative order within the object is unspecified.
* It is unspecified what order the base class subobjects appear in within an object, whether they occur consecutively, and whether they appear before, after, or between member subobjects.

## Arithmetic types
Narrow character types
======================

The `unsigned char` type uses all bits to represent a binary number. Therefore, for example, if `unsigned char` is 8 bits long, then the 256 possible bit patterns of a `char` object represent the 256 different values {0, 1, ..., 255}. The number 42 is guaranteed to be represented by the bit pattern `00101010`.

The `signed char` type has no padding bits, *i.e.,* if `signed char` is 8 bits long, then it has 8 bits of capacity to represent a number.

Note that these guarantees do not apply to types other than narrow character types.

Integer types
=============

The unsigned integer types use a pure binary system, but may contain padding bits. For example, it is possible (though unlikely) for `unsigned int` to be 64 bits long but only  be capable of storing integers between 0 and 2<sup>32</sup> - 1, inclusive. The other 32 bits would be padding bits, which should not be written to directly.

The signed integer types use a binary system with a sign bit and possibly padding bits. Values that belong to the common range of a signed integer type and the corresponding unsigned integer type have the same representation. For example, if the bit pattern `0001010010101011` of an `unsigned short` object represents the value `5291`, then it also represents the value `5291` when interpreted as a `short` object.

It is implementation-defined whether a two's complement, one's complement, or sign-magnitude representation is used, since all three systems satisfy the requirement in the previous paragraph.

Floating point types
====================

The value representation of floating point types is implementation-defined. Most commonly, the `float` and `double` types conform to IEEE 754 and are 32 and 64 bits long (so, for example, `float` would have 23 bits of precision which would follow 8 exponent bits and 1 sign bit). However, the standard does not guarantee anything. Floating point types often have "trap representations", which cause errors when they are used in calculations.

## Arrays
An array type has no padding in between its elements. Therefore, an array with element type `T` is just a sequence of `T` objects laid out in memory, in order.

A multidimensional array is an array of arrays, and the above applies recursively. For example, if we have the declaration

    int a[5][3];

then `a` is an array of 5 arrays of 3 `int`s. Therefore, `a[0]`, which consists of the three elements `a[0][0]`, `a[0][1]`, `a[0][2]`, is laid out in memory before `a[1]`, which consists of `a[1][0]`, `a[1][1]`, and `a[1][2]`. This is called *row major* order.
