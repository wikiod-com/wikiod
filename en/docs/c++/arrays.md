Arrays are elements of the same type placed in adjoining memory locations. The elements can be individually referenced by a unique identifier with an added index.

This allows you to declare multiple variable values of a specific type and access them individually without needing to declare a variable for each value.

## Array initialization
An array is just a block of sequential memory locations for a specific type of variable. Arrays are allocated the same way as normal variables, but with square brackets appended to its name `[]` that contain the number of elements that fit into the array memory.

The following example of an array uses the typ `int`, the variable name `arrayOfInts`, and the number of elements `[5]` that the array has space for:

    int arrayOfInts[5];

An array can be declared and initialized at the same time like this

    int arrayOfInts[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

When initializing an array by listing all of its members, it is not necessary to include the number of elements inside the square brackets. It will be automatically calculated by the compiler. In the following example, it's 5:

    int arrayOfInts[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

It is also possible to initialize only the first elements while allocating more space. In this case, defining the length in brackets is mandatory. The following will allocate an array of length 5 with partial initialization, the compiler initializes all remaining elements with the standard value of the element type, in this case zero.

    int arrayOfInts[5] = {10,20}; // means 10, 20, 0, 0, 0

Arrays of other basic data types may be initialized in the same way.

    char arrayOfChars[5]; // declare the array and allocate the memory, don't initialize
    
    char arrayOfChars[5] = { 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' } ; //declare and initialize
    
    double arrayOfDoubles[5] = {1.14159, 2.14159, 3.14159, 4.14159, 5.14159};
    
    string arrayOfStrings[5] = { "C++", "is", "super", "duper", "great!"};

It is also important to take note that when accessing array elements, the array's element index(or position) starts from 0.

    int array[5] = { 10/*Element no.0*/, 20/*Element no.1*/, 30, 40, 50/*Element no.4*/};
    std::cout << array[4]; //outputs 50
    std::cout << array[0]; //outputs 10

            { 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 }
        };
        
        for( int y = 0; y < n_rows; ++y )
        {
            for( int x = 0; x < n_cols; ++x )
            {
                cout << setw( 4 ) << m[y][x];       // Note: do NOT use m[y,x]!
            }
            cout << '\n';
        }
    }

Output:

   1   2   3   4   5   6   7

C++ doesn't support special syntax for indexing a multi-dimensional array. Instead such an array is viewed as an array of arrays (possibly of arrays, and so on), and the ordinary single index notation `[`*`i`*`]` is used for each level. In the example above `m[y]` refers to row `y` of `m`, where `y` is a zero-based index. Then this row can be indexed in turn, e.g. `m[y][x]`, which refers to the `x`<sup>th</sup> item &ndash; or column &ndash; of row `y`.

I.e. the last index varies fastest, and in the declaration the range of this index, which here is the number of columns per row, is the last and &ldquo;innermost&rdquo; size specified.

Since C++ doesn't provide built-in support for dynamic size arrays, other than dynamic allocation, a dynamic size matrix is often implemented as a class. Then the raw array matrix indexing notation `m[y][x]` has some cost, either by exposing the implementation (so that e.g. a view of a transposed matrix becomes practically impossible) or by adding some overhead and slight inconvenience when it's done by returning a proxy object from `operator[]`. And so the indexing notation for such an abstraction can and will usually be different, both in look-and-feel and in the order of indices, e.g. `m(x,y)` or `m.at(x,y)` or `m.item(x,y)`.

## Dynamically sized raw array
    // Example of raw dynamic size array. It's generally better to use std::vector.
    #include <algorithm>            // std::sort
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    auto int_from( istream& in ) -> int { int x; in >> x; return x; }

    auto main()
        -> int
    {
        cout << "Sorting n integers provided by you.\n";
        cout << "n? ";
        int const   n   = int_from( cin );
        int*        a   = new int[n];       // ← Allocation of array of n items.
        
        for( int i = 1; i <= n; ++i )
        {
            cout << "The #" << i << " number, please: ";
            a[i-1] = int_from( cin );
        }

        sort( a, a + n );
        for( int i = 0; i < n; ++i ) { cout << a[i] << ' '; }
        cout << '\n';
        
        delete[] a;
    }

A program that declares an array `T a[n];` where `n` is determined a run-time, can compile with certain compilers that support C99 *variadic length arrays* (VLAs) as a language extension. But VLAs are not supported by standard C++. This example shows how to manually allocate a dynamic size array via a `new[]`-expression,

    int*        a   = new int[n];       // ← Allocation of array of n items.

&hellip; then use it, and finally deallocate it via a `delete[]`-expression:

    delete[] a;

The array allocated here has indeterminate values, but it can be zero-initialized by just adding an empty parenthesis `()`, like this: `new int[n]()`. More generally, for arbitrary item type, this performs a *value-initialization*.

As part of a function down in a call hierarchy this code would not be exception safe, since an exception before the `delete[]` expression (and after the `new[]`) would cause a memory leak. One way to address that issue is to automate the cleanup via e.g. a `std::unique_ptr` smart pointer. But a generally better way to address it is to just use a `std::vector`: that's what `std::vector` is there for.


## Array size: type safe at compile time.
    #include <stddef.h>     // size_t, ptrdiff_t
    
    //----------------------------------- Machinery:
    
    using Size = ptrdiff_t;
    
    template< class Item, size_t n >
    constexpr auto n_items( Item (&)[n] ) noexcept
        -> Size
    { return n; }
    
    
    //----------------------------------- Usage:
    
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    auto main()
        -> int
    {
        int const   a[]     = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 4};
        Size const  n       = n_items( a );
        int         b[n]    = {};       // An array of the same size as a.
        
        (void) b;
        cout << "Size = " << n << "\n";
    }

The C idiom for array size, `sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0])`, will accept a pointer as argument and will then generally yield an incorrect result.

For C++11

using C++11 you can do:


    std::extent<decltype(MyArray)>::value;

Example:

    char MyArray[] = { 'X','o','c','e' };
    const auto n = std::extent<decltype(MyArray)>::value;
    std::cout << n << "\n"; // Prints 4

Up till C++17 (forthcoming as of this writing) C++ had no built-in core language or standard library utility to obtain the size of an array, but this can be implemented by passing the array *by reference* to a function template, as shown above. Fine but important point: the template size parameter is a `size_t`, somewhat inconsistent with the signed `Size` function result type, in order to accommodate the g++ compiler which sometimes insists on `size_t` for template matching.

With C++17 and later one may instead use [`std::size`][1], which is specialized for arrays.

## Expanding dynamic size array by using std::vector.
    // Example of std::vector as an expanding dynamic size array.
    #include <algorithm>            // std::sort
    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>               // std::vector
    using namespace std;

    int int_from( std::istream& in ) { int x = 0; in >> x; return x; }

    int main()
    {
        cout << "Sorting integers provided by you.\n";
        cout << "You can indicate EOF via F6 in Windows or Ctrl+D in Unix-land.\n";
        vector<int> a;      // ← Zero size by default.

        while( cin )
        {
            cout << "One number, please, or indicate EOF: ";
            int const x = int_from( cin );
            if( !cin.fail() ) { a.push_back( x ); }  // Expands as necessary.
        }

        sort( a.begin(), a.end() );
        int const n = a.size();
        for( int i = 0; i < n; ++i ) { cout << a[i] << ' '; }
        cout << '\n';
    }

`std::vector` is a standard library class template that provides the notion of a variable size array. It takes care of all the memory management, and the buffer is contiguous so a pointer to the buffer (e.g. `&v[0]` or `v.data()`) can be passed to API functions requiring a raw array. A `vector` can even be expanded at run time, via e.g. the `push_back` member function that appends an item.

The complexity of the sequence of *n* `push_back` operations, including the copying or moving involved in the vector expansions, is amortized O(*n*). &ldquo;Amortized&rdquo;: on average.

Internally this is usually achieved by the vector *doubling* its buffer size, its capacity, when a larger buffer is needed. E.g. for a buffer starting out as size 1, and being repeatedly doubled as needed for *n*=17 `push_back` calls, this involves 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 copy operations, which is less than 2×*n* = 34. And more generally the sum of this sequence can't exceed 2×*n*.

Compared to the dynamic size raw array example, this `vector`-based code does not require the user to supply (and know) the number of items up front. Instead the vector is just expanded as necessary, for each new item value specified by the user.


## A dynamic size matrix using std::vector for storage.
Unfortunately as of C++14 there's no dynamic size matrix class in the C++ standard library. Matrix classes that support dynamic size are however available from a number of 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries, including the Boost Matrix library (a sub-library within the Boost library).

If you don't want a dependency on Boost or some other library, then one poor man's dynamic size matrix in C++ is just like

    vector<vector<int>> m( 3, vector<int>( 7 ) );

&hellip; where `vector` is `std::vector`. The matrix is here created by copying a row vector *n* times where *n* is the number of rows, here 3. It has the advantage of providing the same `m[y][x]` indexing notation as for a fixed size raw array matrix, but it's a bit inefficient because it involves a dynamic allocation for each row, and it's a bit unsafe because it's possible to inadvertently resize a row.

A more safe and efficient approach is to use a single vector as *storage* for the matrix, and map the client code's (*x*, *y*) to a corresponding index in that vector:

    // A dynamic size matrix using std::vector for storage.

The above code is not industrial grade: it's designed to show the basic principles, and serve the needs of students learning C++.

For example, one may define `operator()` overloads to simplify the indexing notation.
