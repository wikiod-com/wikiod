When compiling, the compiler will often modify the program to increase performance. This is permitted by the [as-if rule](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/as_if), which allows any and all transformations that do not change observable behavior.

## Inline Expansion/Inlining
Inline expansion (also known as inlining) is compiler optimisation that replaces a call to a function with the body of that function. This saves the function call overhead, but at the cost of space, since the function may be duplicated several times.

    // source:

    int process(int value)
    {
        return 2 * value;
    }

    int foo(int a)
    {
        return process(a);
    }

    // program, after inlining:

    int foo(int a)
    {
        return 2 * a; // the body of process() is copied into foo()
    }

Inlining is most commonly done for small functions, where the function call overhead is significant compared to the size of the function body.

## Empty base optimization
The size of any object or member subobject is required to be at least 1 even if the type is an empty `class` type (that is, a `class` or `struct` that has no non-static data members), in order to be able to guarantee that the addresses of distinct objects of the same type are always distinct.

However, base `class` subobjects are not so constrained, and can be completely optimized out from the object layout:

    #include <cassert>

    struct Base {}; // empty class

    struct Derived1 : Base {
        int i;
    };

    int main() {
        // the size of any object of empty class type is at least 1
        assert(sizeof(Base) == 1);

        // empty base optimization applies
        assert(sizeof(Derived1) == sizeof(int));
    }

Empty base optimization is commonly used by allocator-aware standard library classes (`std::vector`, `std::function`, `std::shared_ptr`, etc) to avoid occupying any additional storage for its allocator member if the allocator is stateless. This is achieved by storing one of the required data members (e.g., `begin`, `end`, or `capacity` pointer for the `vector`).
