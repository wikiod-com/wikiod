The standard library `<iostream>` defines few streams for input and output:

    |stream | description                      |
    |-------|----------------------------------|
    |cin    | standard input stream            |
    |cout   | standard output stream           |
    |cerr   | standard error (output) stream   |
    |clog   | standard logging (output) stream |

Out of four streams mentioned above `cin` is basically used for user input and other three are used for outputting the data. In general or in most coding environments `cin` (*console input* or standard input) is keyboard and `cout` (*console output* or standard output) is monitor.

    cin >> value

    cin   - input stream
    '>>'  - extraction operator
    value - variable (destination)
`cin` here extracts the input entered by the user and feeds in variable value. The value is extracted only after user presses ENTER key.

    cout << "Enter a value: "

    cout              - output stream
    '<<'              - insertion operator
    "Enter a value: " - string to be displayed
`cout` here takes the string to be displayed and inserts it to standard output or monitor

All four streams are located in standard namespace `std` so we need to print `std::stream` for stream `stream` to use it.

There is also a manipulator `std::endl` in code. It can be used only with output streams. It inserts end of line `'\n'` character in the stream and flushes it. It causes immediately producing output.

## user input and standard output
    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
        int value;
        std::cout << "Enter a value: " << std::endl;
        std::cin >> value;
        std::cout << "The square of entered value is: " << value * value << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
