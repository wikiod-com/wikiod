## Using optionals to represent the absence of a value
Before C++17, having pointers with a value of `nullptr` commonly represented the absence of a value. This is a good solution for large objects that have been dynamically allocated and are already managed by pointers. However, this solution does not work well for small or primitive types such as `int`, which are rarely ever dynamically allocated or managed by pointers. `std::optional` provides a viable solution to this common problem.

In this example, `struct Person` is defined. It is possible for a person to have a pet, but not necessary. Therefore, the `pet` member of `Person` is declared with an `std::optional` wrapper.

    #include <iostream>
    #include <optional>
    #include <string>
    
    struct Animal {
        std::string name;
    };
    
    struct Person {
        std::string name;
        std::optional<Animal> pet;
    };
    
    int main() {
        Person person;
        person.name = "John";
    
        if (person.pet) {
            std::cout << person.name << "'s pet's name is " <<
                person.pet->name << std::endl;
        }
        else {
            std::cout << person.name << " is alone." << std::endl;
        }
    }


## optional as return value
    std::optional<float> divide(float a, float b) {
      if (b!=0.f) return a/b;
      return {};
    }
Here we return either the fraction `a/b`, but if it is not defined (would be infinity) we instead return the empty optional.

A more complex case:

    template<class Range, class Pred>
    auto find_if( Range&& r, Pred&& p ) {
      using std::begin; using std::end;
      auto b = begin(r), e = end(r);
      auto r = std::find_if(b, e , p );
      using iterator = decltype(r);
      if (r==e)
        return std::optional<iterator>();
      return std::optional<iterator>(r);
    }
    template<class Range, class T>
    auto find( Range&& r, T const& t ) {
      return find_if( std::forward<Range>(r), [&t](auto&& x){return x==t;} );
    }
`find( some_range, 7 )` searches the container or range `some_range` for something equal to the number `7`.  `find_if` does it with a predicate.

It returns either an empty optional if it was not found, or an optional containing an iterator tothe element if it was.

This allows you to do:

    if (find( vec, 7 )) {
      // code
    }
or even

    if (auto oit = find( vec, 7 )) {
      vec.erase(*oit);
    }
without having to mess around with begin/end iterators and tests.


## Introduction
Optionals (also known as Maybe types) are used to represent a type whose contents may or may not be present. They are implemented in C++17 as the `std::optional` class. For example, an object of type `std::optional<int>` may contain some value of type `int`, or it may contain no value.

Optionals are commonly used either to represent a value that may not exist or as a return type from a function that can fail to return a meaningful result. 

## Other approaches to optional

There are many other approach to solving the problem that `std::optional` solves, but none of them are quite complete: using a pointer, using a sentinel, or using a `pair<bool, T>`. 

### Optional vs Pointer

In some cases, we can provide a pointer to an existing object or `nullptr` to indicate failure. But this is limited to those cases where objects already exist - `optional`, as a value type, can also be used to return new objects without resorting to memory allocation.

### Optional vs Sentinel

A common idiom is to use a special value to indicate that the value is meaningless. This may be 0 or -1 for integral types, or `nullptr` for pointers. However, this reduces the space of valid values (you cannot differentiate between a valid 0 and a meaningless 0) and many types do not have a natural choice for the sentinel value.

### Optional vs `std::pair<bool, T>`

Another common idiom is to provide a pair, where one of the elements is a `bool` indicating whether or not the value is meaningful.

This relies upon the value type being default-constructible in the case of error, which is not possible for some types and possible but undesirable for others. An `optional<T>`, in the case of error, does not need to construct anything.

## value_or


## Using optionals to represent the failure of a function
Before C++17, a function typically represented failure in one of several ways:

* A null pointer was returned.
    * e.g. Calling a function `Delegate *App::get_delegate()` on an `App` instance that did not have a delegate would return `nullptr`.
    * This is a good solution for objects that have been dynamically allocated or are large and managed by pointers, but isn't a good solution for small objects that are typically stack-allocated and passed by copying.
* A specific value of the return type was reserved to indicate failure.
    * e.g. Calling a function `unsigned shortest_path_distance(Vertex a, Vertex b)` on two vertices that are not connected may return zero to indicate this fact.
* The value was paired together with a `bool` to indicate is the returned value was meaningful.
    * e.g. Calling a function `std::pair<int, bool> parse(const std::string &str)` with a string argument that is not an integer would return a pair with an undefined `int` and a `bool` set to `false`.

In this example, John is given two pets, Fluffy and Furball. The function `Person::pet_with_name()` is then called to retrieve John's pet Whiskers. Since John does not have a pet named Whiskers, the function fails and `std::nullopt` is returned instead.

    #include <iostream>
    #include <optional>
    #include <string>
    #include <vector>
    
    struct Animal {
        std::string name;
    };
    
    struct Person {
        std::string name;
        std::vector<Animal> pets;
        
        std::optional<Animal> pet_with_name(const std::string &name) {
            for (const Animal &pet : pets) {
                if (pet.name == name) {
                    return pet;
                }
            }
            return std::nullopt;
        }
    };
    
    int main() {
        Person john;
        john.name = "John";
        
        Animal fluffy;
        fluffy.name = "Fluffy";
        john.pets.push_back(fluffy);
        
        Animal furball;
        furball.name = "Furball";
        john.pets.push_back(furball);
        
        std::optional<Animal> whiskers = john.pet_with_name("Whiskers");
        if (whiskers) {
            std::cout << "John has a pet named Whiskers." << std::endl;
        }
        else {
            std::cout << "Whiskers must not belong to John." << std::endl;
        }
    }
