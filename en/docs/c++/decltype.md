The keyword `decltype` can be used to get the type of a variable, function or an expression. 

## Basic Example
This example just illustrates how this keyword can be used.

    int a = 10;
    
    // Assume that type of variable 'a' is not known here, or it may
    // be changed by programmer (from int to long long, for example).
    // Hence we declare another variable, 'b' of the same type using 
    // decltype keyword.
    decltype(a) b; // 'decltype(a)' evaluates to 'int'

If, for example, someone changes, type of 'a' to:

`float a=99.0f;`

Then the type of variable `b` now automatically becomes `float`.


## Another example
Let's say we have vector:

    std::vector<int> intVector;

And we want to declare an iterator for this vector. An obvious idea is to use `auto`. However, it may be needed just declare an iterator variable (and not to assign it to anything). We would do:

    vector<int>::iterator iter;

However, with `decltype` it becomes easy and less error prone (if type of `intVector` changes).

    decltype(intVector)::iterator iter;
Alternatively:


    decltype(intVector.begin()) iter;

In second example, the return type of `begin` is used to determine the actual type, which is `vector<int>::iterator`. 

If we need a const_iterator, we just need to use `cbegin`:

    decltype(intVector.cbegin()) iter; // vector<int>::const_iterator
