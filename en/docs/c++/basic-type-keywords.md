## int
Denotes a signed integer type with "the natural size suggested by the
architecture of the execution environment", whose range includes at least -32767 to +32767, inclusive.

    int x = 2;
    int y = 3;
    int z = x + y;

Can be combined with `unsigned`, `short`, `long`, and `long long` (q.v.) in order to yield other integer types.

## bool
An integer type whose value can be either `true` or `false`.

    bool is_even(int x) {
        return x%2 == 0;
    }
    const bool b = is_even(47); // false

## char
An integer type which is "large enough to store any member of the implementation’s basic
character set". It is implementation-defined whether `char` is signed (and has a range of at least -127 to +127, inclusive) or unsigned (and has a range of at least 0 to 255, inclusive).

    const char zero = '0';
    const char one = zero + 1;
    const char newline = '\n';
    std::cout << one << newline; // prints 1 followed by a newline

## char16_t
<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
An unsigned integer type with the same size and alignment as `uint_least16_t`, which is therefore large enough to hold a UTF-16 code unit.

    const char16_t message[] = u"你好，世界\n";            // Chinese for "hello, world\n"
    std::cout << sizeof(message)/sizeof(char16_t) << "\n"; // prints 7

<!-- end version if -->

## char32_t
<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
An unsigned integer type with the same size and alignment as `uint_least32_t`, which is therefore large enough to hold a UTF-32 code unit.

    const char32_t full_house[] = U"🂣🂳🂨🂸🃈";               // non-BMP characters
    std::cout << sizeof(full_house)/sizeof(char32_t) << "\n"; // prints 6
<!-- end version if -->

## float
A floating point type. Has the narrowest range out of the three floating point types in C++.

    float area(float radius) {
        const float pi = 3.14159f;
        return pi*radius*radius;
    }

## double
A floating point type. Its range includes that of `float`. When combined with `long`, denotes the `long double` floating point type, whose range includes that of `double`.

    double area(double radius) {
        const double pi = 3.141592653589793;
        return pi*radius*radius;
    }

## long
Denotes a signed integer type that is at least as long as `int`, and whose range includes at least -2147483647 to +2147483647, inclusive (that is, -(2^31 - 1) to +(2^31 - 1)). This type can also be written as `long int`.

    const long approx_seconds_per_year = 60L*60L*24L*365L;

The combination `long double` denotes a floating point type, which has the widest range out of the three floating point types.

    long double area(long double radius) {
        const long double pi = 3.1415926535897932385L;
        return pi*radius*radius;
    }

<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
When the `long` specifier occurs twice, as in `long long`, it denotes a signed integer type that is at least as long as `long`, and whose range includes at least -9223372036854775807 to +9223372036854775807, inclusive (that is, -(2^63 - 1) to +(2^63 - 1)).

    // support files up to 2 TiB
    const long long max_file_size = 2LL << 40;

<!-- end version if -->

## short
Denotes a signed integer type that is at least as long as `char`, and whose range includes at least -32767 to +32767, inclusive. This type can also be written as `short int`.

    // (during the last year)
    short hours_worked(short days_worked) {
        return 8*days_worked;
    }

## void
An incomplete type; it is not possible for an object to have type `void`, nor are there arrays of `void` or references to `void`. It is used as the return type of functions that do not return anything.

Moreover, a function may redundantly be declared with a single parameter of type `void`; this is equivalent to declaring a function with no parameters (e.g. `int main()` and `int main(void)` declare the same function). This syntax is allowed for compatibility with C (where function declarations have a different meaning than in C++).

The type `void*` ("pointer to `void`") has the property that any object pointer can be converted to it and back and result in the same pointer. This feature makes the type `void*` suitable for certain kinds of (type-unsafe) type-erasing interfaces, for example for generic contexts in C-style APIs (e.g. `qsort`, `pthread_create`).

Any expression may be converted to an expression of type `void`; this is called a *discarded-value expression*:

    static_cast<void>(std::printf("Hello, %s!\n", name));  // discard return value

This may be useful to signal explicitly that the value of an expression is not of interest and that the expression is to be evaluated for its side effects only.

## wchar_t
An integer type large enough to represent all characters of the largest supported extended character set, also known as the wide-character set. (It is not portable to make the assumption that `wchar_t` uses any particular encoding, such as UTF-16.)

It is normally used when you need to store characters over ASCII 255 , as it has a greater size than the character type `char`.

    const wchar_t message_ahmaric[] = L"ሰላም ልዑል\n"; //Ahmaric for "hello, world\n"
    const wchar_t message_chinese[] = L"你好，世界\n";// Chinese for "hello, world\n"
    const wchar_t message_hebrew[]  = L"שלום עולם\n"; //Hebrew for "hello, world\n"
    const wchar_t message_russian[] = L"Привет мир\n";  //Russian for "hello, world\n"
    const wchar_t message_tamil[]   = L"ஹலோ உலகம்\n"; //Tamil for "hello, world\n"
