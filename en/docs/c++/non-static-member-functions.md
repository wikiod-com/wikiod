## Syntax
 - // Calling:
   - variable.member_function();
   - variable_pointer->member_function();

 - // Definition:
   - ret_type class_name::member_function() cv-qualifiers {
     - body;
   * }

 - // Prototype:
   - class class_name {
     - virt-specifier ret_type member_function() cv-qualifiers virt-specifier-seq;
     - // virt-specifier: "virtual", if applicable.
     - // cv-qualifiers: "const" and/or "volatile", if applicable.
     - // virt-specifier-seq: "override" and/or "final", if applicable.
   * }

A non-`static` member function is a [`class`/`struct`/`union`][1] member function, which is called on a particular instance, and operates on said instance.  Unlike `static` member functions, it cannot be called without specifying an instance.

For information on classes, structures, and unions, please see [the parent topic][1].

## Non-static Member Functions
A `class` or `struct` can have member functions as well as member variables.  These functions have syntax mostly similar to standalone functions, and can be defined either inside or outside the class definition; if defined outside the class definition, the function's name is prefixed with the class' name and the scope (`::`) operator.

    class CL {
      public:
        void  definedInside() {}
        void definedOutside();
    };
    void CL::definedOutside() {}

These functions are called on an instance (or reference to an instance) of the class with the dot (`.`) operator, or a pointer to an instance with the arrow (`->`) operator, and each call is tied to the instance the function was called on; when a member function is called on an instance, it has access to all of that instance's fields (through the [`this` pointer][1]), but can only access other instances' fields if those instances are supplied as parameters.

    struct ST {
        ST(const std::string& ss = "Wolf", int ii = 359) : s(ss), i(ii) { }

        int get_i() const { return i; }
        bool compare_i(const ST& other) const { return (i == other.i); }

      private:
        std::string s;
        int i;
    };
    ST st1;
    ST st2("Species", 8472);

    int  i = st1.get_i(); // Can access st1.i, but not st2.i.
    bool b = st1.compare_i(st2); // Can access st1 & st2.

These functions are allowed to access member variables and/or other member functions, regardless of either the variable or function's access modifiers.  They can also be written out-of-order, accessing member variables and/or calling member functions declared before them, as the entire class definition must be parsed before the compiler can begin to compile a class.

    class Access {
      public:
        Access(int i_ = 8088, int j_ = 8086, int k_ = 6502) : i(i_), j(j_), k(k_) {}

        int i;
        int get_k() const { return k; }
        bool private_no_more() const { return i_be_private(); }
      protected:
        int j;
        int get_i() const { return i; }
      private:
        int k;
        int get_j() const { return j; }
        bool i_be_private() const { return ((i > j) && (k < j)); }
    };

## Encapsulation
A common use of member functions is for encapsulation, using an _accessor_ (commonly known as a getter) and a _mutator_ (commonly known as a setter) instead of accessing fields directly.

    class Encapsulator {
        int encapsulated;

      public:
        int  get_encapsulated() const { return encapsulated; }
        void set_encapsulated(int e)  { encapsulated = e; }

        void some_func() {
            do_something_with(encapsulated);
        }
    };

Inside the class, `encapsulated` can be freely accessed by any non-static member function; outside the class, access to it is regulated by member functions, using `get_encapsulated()` to read it and `set_encapsulated()` to modify it.  This prevents unintentional modifications to the variable, as separate functions are used to read and write it.  [There are many discussions on whether getters and setters provide or break encapsulation, with good arguments for both claims; such heated debate is outside the scope of this example.]

## Name Hiding & Importing
When a base class provides a set of overloaded functions, and a derived class adds another overload to the set, this hides all of the overloads provided by the base class.

    struct HiddenBase {
        void f(int) { std::cout << "int" << std::endl; }
        void f(bool) { std::cout << "bool" << std::endl; }
        void f(std::string) { std::cout << "std::string" << std::endl; }
    };

    struct HidingDerived : HiddenBase {
        void f(float) { std::cout << "float" << std::endl; }
    };

    // ...

    HiddenBase hb;
    HidingDerived hd;
    std::string s;

    hb.f(1);    // Output:  int
    hb.f(true); // Output:  bool
    hb.f(s);    // Output:  std::string;

    hd.f(1.f);  // Output:  float
    hd.f(3);    // Output:  float
    hd.f(true); // Output:  float
    hd.f(s);    // Error: Can't convert from std::string to float.

This is due to name resolution rules: During name lookup, once the correct name is found, we stop looking, even if we clearly haven't found the correct _version_ of the entity with that name (such as with `hd.f(s)`); due to this, overloading the function in the derived class prevents name lookup from discovering the overloads in the base class.  To avoid this, a using-declaration can be used to "import" names from the base class into the derived class, so that they will be available during name lookup.

    struct HidingDerived : HiddenBase {
         // All members named HiddenBase::f shall be considered members of HidingDerived for lookup.
        using HiddenBase::f;

        void f(float) { std::cout << "float" << std::endl; }
    };

    // ...

    HidingDerived hd;

    hd.f(1.f);  // Output:  float
    hd.f(3);    // Output:  int
    hd.f(true); // Output:  bool
    hd.f(s);    // Output:  std::string

If a derived class imports names with a using-declaration, but also declares functions with the same signature as functions in the base class, the base class functions will silently be overridden or hidden.

    struct NamesHidden {
        virtual void hide_me()      {}
        virtual void hide_me(float) {}
        void hide_me(int)           {}
        void hide_me(bool)          {}
    };

    struct NameHider : NamesHidden {
        using NamesHidden::hide_me;

        void hide_me()    {} // Overrides NamesHidden::hide_me().
        void hide_me(int) {} // Hides NamesHidden::hide_me(int).
    };


A using-declaration can also be used to change access modifiers, provided the imported entity was `public` or `protected` in the base class.

    struct ProMem {
      protected:
        void func() {}
    };

    struct BecomesPub : ProMem {
        using ProMem::func;
    };

    // ...

    ProMem pm;
    BecomesPub bp;

    pm.func(); // Error: protected.
    bp.func(); // Good.

Similarly, if we explicitly want to call a member function from a specific class in the inheritance hierarchy, we can qualify the function name when calling the function, specifying that class by name.

    struct One {
        virtual void f() { std::cout << "One." << std::endl; }
    };

    struct Two : One {
        void f() override {
            One::f(); // this->One::f();
            std::cout << "Two." << std::endl;
        }
    };

    struct Three : Two {
        void f() override {
            Two::f(); // this->Two::f();
            std::cout << "Three." << std::endl;
        }
    };

    // ...

    Three t;

    t.f();      // Normal syntax.
    t.Two::f(); // Calls version of f() defined in Two.
    t.One::f(); // Calls version of f() defined in One.

## Virtual Member Functions
[Member functions can also be declared `virtual`.][1]  In this case, if called on a pointer or reference to an instance, they will not be accessed directly; rather, they will look up the function in the virtual function table (a list of pointers-to-member-functions for virtual functions, more commonly known as the `vtable` or `vftable`), and use that to call the version appropriate for the instance's dynamic (actual) type.  If the function is called directly, from a variable of a class, no lookup is performed.

    struct Base {
        virtual void func() { std::cout << "In Base." << std::endl; }
    };

    struct Derived : Base {
        void func() override { std::cout << "In Derived." << std::endl; }
    };

    void slicer(Base x) { x.func(); }

    // ...

    Base b;
    Derived d;

    Base *pb = &b, *pd = &d; // Pointers.
    Base &rb = b, &rd = d;   // References.

    b.func();   // Output:  In Base.
    d.func();   // Output:  In Derived.

    pb->func(); // Output:  In Base.
    pd->func(); // Output:  In Derived.

    rb.func();  // Output:  In Base.
    rd.func();  // Output:  In Derived.

    slicer(b);  // Output:  In Base.
    slicer(d);  // Output:  In Base.

Note that while `pd` is ` Base*`, and `rd` is a `Base&`, calling `func()` on either of the two calls `Derived::func()` instead of `Base::func()`; this is because the `vtable` for `Derived` updates the `Base::func()` entry to instead point to `Derived::func()`.  Conversely, note how passing an instance to `slicer()` always results in `Base::func()` being called, even when the passed instance is a `Derived`; this is because of something known as _data slicing_, where passing a `Derived` instance into a `Base` parameter by value renders the portion of the `Derived` instance that isn't a `Base` instance inaccessible.

When a member function is defined as virtual, all derived class member functions with the same signature override it, regardless of whether the overriding function is specified as `virtual` or not.  This can make derived classes harder for programmers to parse, however, as there's no indication as to which function(s) is/are `virtual`.

    struct B {
        virtual void f() {}
    };

    struct D : B {
        void f() {} // Implicitly virtual, overrides B::f.
                    //  You'd have to check B to know that, though.
    };

Note, however, that a derived function only overrides a base function if their signatures match; even if a derived function is explicitly declared `virtual`, it will instead create a new virtual function if the signatures are mismatched.

    struct BadB {
        virtual void f() {}
    };

    struct BadD : BadB {
        virtual void f(int i) {} // Does NOT override BadB::f.
    };

<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
As of C++11, intent to override can be made explicit with the context-sensitive keyword `override`.  This tells the compiler that the programmer expects it to override a base class function, which causes the compiler to omit an error if it _doesn't_ override anything.

    struct CPP11B {
        virtual void f() {}
    };

    struct CPP11D : CPP11B {
        void f() override {}
        void f(int i) override {} // Error: Doesn't actually override anything.
    };

This also has the benefit of telling programmers that the function is both virtual, and also declared in at least one base class, which can make complex classes easier to parse.

<!-- end version if -->

When a function is declared `virtual`, and defined outside the class definition, the `virtual` specifier must be included in the function declaration, and not repeated in the definition.

<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
This also holds true for `override`.
<!-- end version if -->

    struct VB {
        virtual void f(); // "virtual" goes here.
        void g();
    };
    /* virtual */ void VB::f() {} // Not here.
    virtual void VB::g() {} // Error.

If a base class overloads a `virtual` function, only overloads that are explicitly specified as `virtual` will be virtual.

    struct BOverload {
        virtual void func() {}
        void func(int) {}
    };

    struct DOverload : BOverload {
        void func() override {}
        void func(int) {}
    };

    // ...

    BOverload* bo = new DOverload;
    bo->func(); // Calls DOverload::func().
    bo->func(1); // Calls BOverload::func(int).

## Const Correctness
One of the primary uses for `this` cv-qualifiers is [_`const` correctness_][1].  This is the practice of guaranteeing that only accesses that _need_ to modify an object are _able_ to modify the object, and that any (member or non-member) function that doesn't need to modify an object doesn't have write access to that object (whether directly or indirectly).  This prevents unintentional modifications, making code less errorprone.  It also allows any function that doesn't need to modify state to be able to take either a `const` or non-`const` object, without needing to rewrite or overload the function.

`const` correctness, due to its nature, starts at the bottom up: Any class member function that doesn't need to change state is [declared as `const`][2], so that it can be called on `const` instances.  This, in turn, allows passed-by-reference parameters to be declared `const` when they don't need to be modified, which allows functions to take either `const` or non-`const` objects without complaining, and `const`-ness can propagate outwards in this manner.  Due to this, getters are frequently `const`, as are any other functions that don't need to modify logical state.

    class ConstIncorrect {
        Field fld;

      public:
        ConstIncorrect(const Field& f) : fld(f) {}     // Modifies.

        const Field& get_field()       { return fld; } // Doesn't modify; should be const.
        void set_field(const Field& f) { fld = f; }    // Modifies.

        void do_something(int i) {                     // Modifies.
            fld.insert_value(i);
        }
        void do_nothing()        { }                   // Doesn't modify; should be const.
    };

    class ConstCorrect {
        Field fld;

      public:
        ConstCorrect(const Field& f) : fld(f) {}       // Not const: Modifies.

        const Field& get_field() const { return fld; } // const: Doesn't modify.
        void set_field(const Field& f) { fld = f; }    // Not const: Modifies.

        void do_something(int i) {                     // Not const: Modifies.
            fld.insert_value(i);
        }
        void do_nothing() const  { }                   // const: Doesn't modify.
    };

    // ...

    const ConstIncorrect i_cant_do_anything(make_me_a_field());
    // Now, let's read it...
    Field f = i_cant_do_anything.get_field();
      // Error: Loses cv-qualifiers, get_field() isn't const.
    i_cant_do_anything.do_nothing();
      // Error: Same as above.
    // Oops.

    const ConstCorrect but_i_can(make_me_a_field());
    // Now, let's read it...
    Field f = but_i_can.get_field(); // Good.
    but_i_can.do_nothing();          // Good.

As illustrated by the comments on `ConstIncorrect` and `ConstCorrect`, properly cv-qualifying functions also serves as documentation.  If a class is `const` correct, any function that isn't `const` can safely be assumed to change state, and any function that is `const` can safely be assumed not to change state.
