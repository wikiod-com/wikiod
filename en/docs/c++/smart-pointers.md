## Syntax
 - `std::shared_ptr<ClassType> variableName = std::make_shared<ClassType>(arg1, arg2, ...);` 
 - `std::shared_ptr<ClassType> variableName (new ClassType(arg1, arg2, ...));`
 - `std::unique_ptr<ClassType> variableName = std::make_unique<ClassType>(arg1, arg2, ...);` // C++14
 - `std::unique_ptr<ClassType> variableName (new ClassType(arg1, arg2, ...));`

C++ is not a memory-managed language. Dynamically allocated memory (i.e. objects created with `new`) will be "leaked" if it is not explicitly deallocated (with `delete`). It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the dynamically allocated memory is freed before discarding the last pointer to that object.

Smart pointers can be used to automatically manage the scope of dynamically allocated memory (i.e. when the last pointer reference goes out of scope it is deleted).

Smart pointers are preferred over "raw" pointers in most cases. They make the ownership semantics of dynamically allocated memory explicit, by communicating in their names whether an object is intended to be shared or uniquely owned.

Use `#include <memory>` to be able to use smart pointers.

## Unique ownership (std::unique_ptr)
<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
A [`std::unique_ptr`][1] is a class template that manages the lifetime of a dynamically stored object. Unlike for [`std::shared_ptr`][2], the dynamic object is owned by only *one instance* of a `std::unique_ptr` at any time, 

---

    // Creates a dynamic int with value of 20 owned by a unique pointer
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(20);

(Note: `std::unique_ptr` is available since C++11 and `std::make_unique` since C++14.)

Only the variable `ptr` holds a pointer to a dynamically allocated `int`. When a unique pointer that owns an object goes out of scope, the owned object is deleted, i.e. its destructor is called if the object is of class type, and the memory for that object is released.

To use `std::unique_ptr` and `std::make_unique` with array-types, use their array specializations:

    // Creates a unique_ptr to an int with value 59
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(59);

    // Creates a unique_ptr to an array of 15 ints
    std::unique_ptr<int[]> ptr = std::make_unique<int[]>(15);

You can access the `std::unique_ptr` just like a raw pointer, because it overloads those operators.

---

You can transfer ownership of the contents of a smart pointer to another pointer by using `std::move`, which will cause the original smart pointer to point to `nullptr`.

    // 1. std::unique_ptr
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>();

    // Change value to 1
    *ptr = 1;

    // 2. std::unique_ptr (by moving 'ptr' to 'ptr2', 'ptr' doesn't own the object anymore)
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr2 = std::move(ptr);

    int a = *ptr2; // 'a' is 1
    int b = *ptr;  // undefined behavior! 'ptr' is 'nullptr'
                   // (because of the move command above)

---

Passing `unique_ptr` to functions as parameter:

    void foo(std::unique_ptr<int> ptr)
    {
        // Your code goes here
    }
    
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(59);
    foo(std::move(ptr))
---

Returning `unique_ptr` from functions. This is the preferred C++11 way of writing factory functions, as it clearly conveys the ownership semantics of the return: the caller owns the resulting `unique_ptr` and is responsible for it. 

    std::unique_ptr<int> foo()
    {
        std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(59);
        return ptr;
    }
    
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = foo();

Compare this to:

    int* foo_cpp03();

    int* p = foo_cpp03(); // do I own p? do I have to delete it at some point?
                          // it's not readily apparent what the answer is.
<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [lt C++14] -->
The class template `make_unique` is provided since C++14. It's easy to add it manually to C++11 code:

    template<typename T, typename... Args>
    typename std::enable_if<!std::is_array<T>::value, std::unique_ptr<T>>::type
    make_unique(Args&&... args)
    { return std::unique_ptr<T>(new T(std::forward<Args>(args)...)); }

    // Use make_unique for arrays
    template<typename T>
    typename std::enable_if<std::is_array<T>::value, std::unique_ptr<T>>::type
    make_unique(size_t n)
    { return std::unique_ptr<T>(new typename std::remove_extent<T>::type[n]()); }
<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [gte C++11] -->
Unlike the *dumb* smart pointer (`std::auto_ptr`), `unique_ptr` can also be instantiated with vector allocation (*not* `std::vector`). Earlier examples were for *scalar* allocations. For example to have a dynamically allocated integer array for 10 elements, you would specify `int[]` as the template type (and not just `int`):

    std::unique_ptr<int[]> arr_ptr = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);

Which can be simplified with:

    auto arr_ptr = std::make_unique<int[]>(10);

Now, you use `arr_ptr` as if it is an array:

    arr_ptr[2] =  10; // Modify third element

You need not to worry about de-allocation. This template specialized version calls constructors and destructors appropriately. Using vectored version of `unique_ptr` or a `vector` itself - is a personal choice.

<!-- end version if -->

In versions prior to C++11, `std::auto_ptr` was available. Unlike `unique_ptr` it is allowed to copy `auto_ptr`s, upon which the source `ptr` will lose the ownership of the contained pointer and the target receives it.

## Sharing ownership (std::shared_ptr)
The class template [`std::shared_ptr`][1] defines a shared pointer that is able to share ownership of an object with other shared pointers. This contrasts to [`std::unique_ptr`][2] which represents exclusive ownership.

The sharing behavior is implemented through a technique known as reference counting, where the number of shared pointers that point to the object is stored alongside it. When this count reaches zero, either through the destruction or reassignment of the last `std::shared_ptr` instance, the object is automatically destroyed.

---

    // Creation: 'firstShared' is a shared pointer for a new instance of 'Foo'
    std::shared_ptr<Foo> firstShared = std::make_shared<Foo>(/*args*/);

To create multiple smart pointers that share the same object, we need to create another `shared_ptr` that aliases the first shared pointer. Here are 2 ways of doing it:

    std::shared_ptr<Foo> secondShared(firstShared);  // 1st way: Copy constructing
    std::shared_ptr<Foo> secondShared;
    secondShared = firstShared;                      // 2nd way: Assigning

Either of the above ways makes `secondShared` a shared pointer that shares ownership of our instance of `Foo` with `firstShared`.

The smart pointer works just like a raw pointer. This means, you can use `*` to dereference them. The regular `->` operator works as well:

    secondShared->test(); // Calls Foo::test()

Finally, when the last aliased `shared_ptr` goes out of scope, the destructor of our `Foo` instance is called.

**Warning:** Constructing a `shared_ptr` might throw a `bad_alloc` exception when extra data for shared ownership semantics needs to be allocated. If the constructor is passed a regular pointer it assumes to own the object pointed to and calls the deleter if an exception is thrown. This means `shared_ptr<T>(new T(args))` will not leak a `T` object if allocation of `shared_ptr<T>` fails. However, it is advisable to use `make_shared<T>(args)` or `allocate_shared<T>(alloc, args)`, which enable the implementation to optimize the memory allocation.

__Allocating Arrays([]) using shared_ptr__


<!-- if version [gte C++11] [lt C++17] -->

Unfortunately, there is no direct way to allocate Arrays using `make_shared<>`.

It is possible to create arrays for `shared_ptr<>` using `new` and `std::default_delete`. 

For example, to allocate an array of 10 integers, we can write the code as

```
shared_ptr<int> sh(new int[10], std::default_delete<int[]>());

```

Specifying `std::default_delete` is mandatory here to make sure that the allocated memory is correctly cleaned up using `delete[]`.

If we know the size at compile time, we can do it this way:

    template<class Arr>
    struct shared_array_maker {};
    template<class T, std::size_t N>
    struct shared_array_maker<T[N]> {
      std::shared_ptr<T> operator()const{
        auto r = std::make_shared<std::array<T,N>>();
        if (!r) return {};
        return {r.data(), r};
      }
    };
    template<class Arr>
    auto make_shared_array()
    -> decltype( shared_array_maker<Arr>{}() )
    { return shared_array_maker<Arr>{}(); }
then `make_shared_array<int[10]>` returns a `shared_ptr<int>` pointing to 10 ints all default constructed.

<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [gte C++17] -->

With C++17, `shared_ptr` [gained special support](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0414r2.html) for array types. It is no longer necessary to specify the array-deleter explicitly, and the shared pointer can be dereferenced using the `[]` array index operator:

    std::shared_ptr<int[]> sh(new int[10]);
    sh[0] = 42;

<!-- end version if -->

---

Shared pointers can point to a sub-object of the object it owns:

    struct Foo { int x; };
    std::shared_ptr<Foo> p1 = std::make_shared<Foo>();
    std::shared_ptr<int> p2(p1, &p1->x);

Both `p2` and `p1` own the object of type `Foo`, but `p2` points to its `int` member `x`. This means that if `p1` goes out of scope or is reassigned, the underlying `Foo` object will still be alive, ensuring that `p2` does not dangle.

---

**Important:** A `shared_ptr` only knows about itself and all other `shared_ptr` that were created with the alias constructor. It does not know about any other pointers, including all other `shared_ptr`s created with a reference to the same `Foo` instance:

    Foo *foo = new Foo;
    std::shared_ptr<Foo> shared1(foo);
    std::shared_ptr<Foo> shared2(foo); // don't do this

    shared1.reset(); // this will delete foo, since shared1
                     // was the only shared_ptr that owned it

    shared2->test(); // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR: shared2's foo has been
                     // deleted already!!

__Ownership Transfer of shared_ptr__

By default, `shared_ptr` increments the reference count and doesn't transfer the ownership. However, it can be made to transfer the ownership using `std::move`: 

```
shared_ptr<int> up = make_shared<int>();
// Transferring the ownership
shared_ptr<int> up2 = move(up);
// At this point, the reference count of up = 0 and the
// ownership of the pointer is solely with up2 with reference count = 1

```


<!-- There is much, much, much more to shared_ptr than this, but it might be a better idea to make that a topic on its own. -->

## Sharing with temporary ownership (std::weak_ptr)
Instances of [`std::weak_ptr`][1] can point to objects owned by instances of [`std::shared_ptr`][2] while only becoming temporary owners themselves. This means that weak pointers do not alter the object's reference count and therefore do not prevent an object's deletion if all of the object's shared pointers are reassigned or destroyed.

---

In the following example instances of `std::weak_ptr` are used so that the destruction of a tree object is not inhibited:

    #include <memory>
    #include <vector>
    
    struct TreeNode {
        std::weak_ptr<TreeNode> parent;
        std::vector< std::shared_ptr<TreeNode> > children;
    };
    
    int main() {
        // Create a TreeNode to serve as the root/parent.
        std::shared_ptr<TreeNode> root(new TreeNode);
    
        // Give the parent 100 child nodes.
        for (size_t i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
            std::shared_ptr<TreeNode> child(new TreeNode);
            root->children.push_back(child);
            child->parent = root;
        }
    
        // Reset the root shared pointer, destroying the root object, and
        // subsequently its child nodes.
        root.reset();
    }

As child nodes are added to the root node's children, their `std::weak_ptr` member `parent` is set to the root node. The member `parent` is declared as a weak pointer as opposed to a shared pointer such that the root node's reference count is not incremented. When the root node is reset at the end of `main()`, the root is destroyed. Since the only remaining `std::shared_ptr` references to the child nodes were contained in the root's collection `children`, all child nodes are subsequently destroyed as well.

Due to control block implementation details, shared_ptr allocated memory may not be released until `shared_ptr` reference counter and `weak_ptr` reference counter both reach zero.

    #include <memory>
    int main()
    {
        {
             std::weak_ptr<int> wk;
             {
                 // std::make_shared is optimized by allocating only once 
                 // while std::shared_ptr<int>(new int(42)) allocates twice.
                 // Drawback of std::make_shared is that control block is tied to our integer
                 std::shared_ptr<int> sh = std::make_shared<int>(42);
                 wk = sh;
                 // sh memory should be released at this point...
             }
             // ... but wk is still alive and needs access to control block
         }
         // now memory is released (sh and wk)
    }

---

Since `std::weak_ptr` does not keep its referenced object alive, direct data access through a `std::weak_ptr` is not possible. Instead it provides a `lock()` member function that attempts to retrieve a `std::shared_ptr` to the referenced object:

    #include <cassert>
    #include <memory>
    int main()
    {
        {
             std::weak_ptr<int> wk;
             std::shared_ptr<int> sp;
             {
                 std::shared_ptr<int> sh = std::make_shared<int>(42);
                 wk = sh;
                 // calling lock will create a shared_ptr to the object referenced by wk
                 sp = wk.lock();
                 // sh will be destroyed after this point, but sp is still alive
             }
             // sp still keeps the data alive.
             // At this point we could even call lock() again 
             // to retrieve another shared_ptr to the same data from wk
             assert(*sp == 42);
             assert(!wk.expired());
             // resetting sp will delete the data,
             // as it is currently the last shared_ptr with ownership
             sp.reset();
             // attempting to lock wk now will return an empty shared_ptr,
             // as the data has already been deleted
             sp = wk.lock();
             assert(!sp);
             assert(wk.expired());
         }
    }

## Using custom deleters to create a wrapper to a C interface
Many C interfaces such as [SDL2][1] have their own deletion functions. This means that you cannot use smart pointers directly:

    std::unique_ptr<SDL_Surface> a; // won't work, UNSAFE!

Instead, you need to define your own deleter. The examples here use the [`SDL_Surface`][2] structure which should be freed using the [`SDL_FreeSurface()`][3] function, but they should be adaptable to many other C interfaces.

The deleter must be callable with a pointer argument, and therefore can be e.g. a simple function pointer:

    std::unique_ptr<SDL_Surface, void(*)(SDL_Surface*)> a(pointer, SDL_FreeSurface);

Any other callable object will work, too, for example a class with an `operator()`:

    struct SurfaceDeleter {
        void operator()(SDL_Surface* surf) {
            SDL_FreeSurface(surf);
        }
    };

    std::unique_ptr<SDL_Surface, SurfaceDeleter> a(pointer, SurfaceDeleter{}); // safe
    std::unique_ptr<SDL_Surface, SurfaceDeleter> b(pointer); // equivalent to the above
                                                             // as the deleter is value-initialized

This not only provides you with safe, zero overhead (if you use [`unique_ptr`][4]) automatic memory management, you also get exception safety. 

Note that the deleter is part of the type for `unique_ptr`, and the implementation can use the [empty base optimization](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%2b%2b/3944/empty-base-optimization#t=201607261453124463486) to avoid any change in size for empty custom deleters. So while `std::unique_ptr<SDL_Surface, SurfaceDeleter>` and `std::unique_ptr<SDL_Surface, void(*)(SDL_Surface*)>` solve the same problem in a similar way, the former type is still only the size of a pointer while the latter type has to hold *two* pointers: both the `SDL_Surface*` and the function pointer! When having free function custom deleters, it is preferable to wrap the function in an empty type. 

In cases where reference counting is important, one could use a [`shared_ptr`][5] instead of an `unique_ptr`. The `shared_ptr` always stores a deleter, this erases the type of the deleter, which might be useful in APIs. The disadvantages of using `shared_ptr` over `unique_ptr` include a higher memory cost for storing the deleter and a performance cost for maintaining the reference count.
 
    // deleter required at construction time and is part of the type
    std::unique_ptr<SDL_Surface, void(*)(SDL_Surface*)> a(pointer, SDL_FreeSurface);

    // deleter is only required at construction time, not part of the type
    std::shared_ptr<SDL_Surface> b(pointer, SDL_FreeSurface); 

<!-- if version [gte C++17] -->

With `template auto`, we can make it even easier to wrap our custom deleters:

    template <auto DeleteFn>
    struct FunctionDeleter {
        template <class T>
        void operator()(T* ptr) {
            DeleteFn(ptr);
        }
    };

    template <class T, auto DeleteFn>
    using unique_ptr_deleter = std::unique_ptr<T, FunctionDeleter<DeleteFn>>;

With which the above example is simply:

    unique_ptr_deleter<SDL_Surface, SDL_FreeSurface> c(pointer);

Here, the purpose of `auto` is to handle all free functions, whether they return `void` (e.g. `SDL_FreeSurface`) or not (e.g. `fclose`).

## Unique ownership without move semantics (auto_ptr)
<!-- if version [lt C++11] -->

**NOTE:** `std::auto_ptr` has been deprecated in C++11 and will be removed in C++17. You should only use this if you are forced to use C++03 or earlier and are willing to be careful. It is recommended to move to unique_ptr in combination with `std::move` to replace `std::auto_ptr` behavior. 

Before we had `std::unique_ptr`, before we had move semantics, we had `std::auto_ptr`. `std::auto_ptr` provides unique ownership but transfers ownership upon copy.

As with all smart pointers, `std::auto_ptr` automatically cleans up resources (see [RAII][1]):

    {
        std::auto_ptr<int> p(new int(42));
        std::cout << *p;
    } // p is deleted here, no memory leaked

but allows only one owner:

    std::auto_ptr<X> px = ...;
    std::auto_ptr<X> py = px; 
      // px is now empty 

This allows to use std::auto_ptr<X> to keep ownership explicit and unique at the danger of losing ownership unintended:

    void f(std::auto_ptr<X> ) {
        // assumes ownership of X
        // deletes it at end of scope
    };

    std::auto_ptr<X> px = ...;
    f(px); // f acquires ownership of underlying X
           // px is now empty
    px->foo(); // NPE!
    // px.~auto_ptr() does NOT delete

The transfer of ownership happened in the "copy" constructor. `auto_ptr`'s copy constructor and copy assignment operator take their operands by non-`const` reference so that they could be modified. An example implementation might be:

    template <typename T>
    class auto_ptr {
        T* ptr;
    public:
        auto_ptr(auto_ptr& rhs)
        : ptr(rhs.release())
        { }

        auto_ptr& operator=(auto_ptr& rhs) {
            reset(rhs.release());
            return *this;
        }

        T* release() {
            T* tmp = ptr;
            ptr = nullptr;
            return tmp;
        }

        void reset(T* tmp = nullptr) {
            if (ptr != tmp) {
                delete ptr;
                ptr = tmp;
            }
        }

        /* other functions ... */
    };

This breaks copy semantics, which require that copying an object leaves you with two equivalent versions of it. For any copyable type, `T`, I should be able to write:

    T a = ...;
    T b(a);
    assert(b == a);

But for `auto_ptr`, this is not the case. As a result, it is not safe to put `auto_ptr`s in containers.

## Casting std::shared_ptr pointers
It is not possible to directly use `static_cast`, `const_cast`, `dynamic_cast` and `reinterpret_cast` on `std::shared_ptr` to retrieve a pointer sharing ownership with the pointer being passed as argument. Instead, the functions `std::static_pointer_cast`, `std::const_pointer_cast`, `std::dynamic_pointer_cast` and `std::reinterpret_pointer_cast` should be used:

    struct Base { virtual ~Base() noexcept {}; };
    struct Derived: Base {};
    auto derivedPtr(std::make_shared<Derived>());
    auto basePtr(std::static_pointer_cast<Base>(derivedPtr));
    auto constBasePtr(std::const_pointer_cast<Base const>(basePtr));
    auto constDerivedPtr(std::dynamic_pointer_cast<Derived const>(constBasePtr));

Note that `std::reinterpret_pointer_cast` is not available in C++11 and C++14, as it was only proposed by [N3920](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3920.html) and adopted into Library Fundamentals TS [in February 2014](https://isocpp.org/blog/2014/02/trip-report). However, it can be implemented as follows:

    template <typename To, typename From>
    inline std::shared_ptr<To> reinterpret_pointer_cast(
        std::shared_ptr<From> const & ptr) noexcept
    { return std::shared_ptr<To>(ptr, reinterpret_cast<To *>(ptr.get())); }

## Writing a smart pointer: value_ptr
A `value_ptr` is a smart pointer that behaves like a value.  When copied, it copies its contents.  When created, it creates its contents.

    // Like std::default_delete:
    template<class T>
    struct default_copier {
      // a copier must handle a null T const* in and return null:
      T* operator()(T const* tin)const {
        if (!tin) return nullptr;
        return new T(*tin);
      }
      void operator()(void* dest, T const* tin)const {
        if (!tin) return;
        return new(dest) T(*tin);
      }
    };
    // tag class to handle empty case:
    struct empty_ptr_t {};

This particular value_ptr is only empty if you construct it with `empty_ptr_t` or if you move from it.  It exposes the fact it is a `unique_ptr`, so `explicit operator bool() const` works on it.  `.get()` has been changed to return a reference (as it is almost never empty), and `.get_pointer()` returns a pointer instead.

This smart pointer can be useful for `pImpl` cases, where we want value-semantics but we also don't want to expose the contents of the `pImpl` outside of the implementation file.

With a non-default `Copier`, it can even handle virtual base classes that know how to produce instances of their derived and turn them into value-types.


## Getting a shared_ptr referring to this
`enable_shared_from_this` enables you to get a valid `shared_ptr` instance to `this`.

By deriving your class from the class template `enable_shared_from_this`, you inherit a method `shared_from_this` that returns a `shared_ptr` instance to `this`.

**Note** that the object must be created as a `shared_ptr` in first place:

    #include <memory>
    class A: public enable_shared_from_this<A> {
    };
    A* ap1 =new A();
    shared_ptr<A> ap2(ap1); // First prepare a shared pointer to the object and hold it!
    // Then get a shared pointer to the object from the object itself
    shared_ptr<A> ap3 = ap1->shared_from_this(); 
    int c3 =ap3.use_count(); // =2: pointing to the same object

**Note**(2) you cannot call `enable_shared_from_this` inside the constructor.


    #include <memory> // enable_shared_from_this

    class Widget : public std::enable_shared_from_this< Widget >
    {
    public:
        void DoSomething()
        {
            std::shared_ptr< Widget > self = shared_from_this();
            someEvent -> Register( self );
        }
    private:
        ...
    };

    int main()
    {
        ...
        auto w = std::make_shared< Widget >();
        w -> DoSomething();
        ...
    }

If you use `shared_from_this()` on an object not owned by a `shared_ptr`, such as a local automatic object or a global object, then the behavior is undefined. Since C++17 it throws `std::bad_alloc` instead.

Using `shared_from_this()` from a constructor is equivalent to using it on an object not owned by a `shared_ptr`, because the objects is possessed by the `shared_ptr` after the constructor returns.
