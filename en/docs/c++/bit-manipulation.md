In order to use [`std::bitset`][1] you will have to include [`<bitset>` header][2].

    #include <bitset>

`std::bitset` overloads all of the operator functions to allow the same usage as the c-style handling of bitsets.

## Toggling a bit
# C-style bit-manipulation

A bit can be toggled using the XOR operator (`^`).

    // Bit x will be the opposite value of what it is currently
    number ^= 1LL << x;

# Using std::bitset

    std::bitset<4> num(std::string("0100"));
    num.flip(2); // num is now 0000
    num.flip(0); // num is now 0001
    num.flip();  // num is now 1110 (flips all bits)

## Checking a bit
# C-style bit-manipulation

The value of the bit can be obtained by shifting the number to the right `x` times and then performing bitwise AND (`&`) on it:

    (number >> x) & 1LL;  // 1 if the 'x'th bit of 'number' is set, 0 otherwise

The right-shift operation may be implemented as either an arithmetic (signed) shift or a logical (unsigned) shift. If `number` in the expression `number >> x` has a signed type and a negative value, the resulting value is implementation-defined.

If we need the value of that bit directly in-place, we could instead left shift the mask:

    (number & (1LL << x));  // (1 << x) if the 'x'th bit of 'number' is set, 0 otherwise

Either can be used as a conditional, since all non-zero values are considered true. 

# Using std::bitset

    std::bitset<4> num(std::string("0010"));
    bool bit_val = num.test(1);  // bit_val value is set to true;

## Set all bits
# C-style bit-manipulation

    x = -1; // -1 == 1111 1111 ... 1111b

 <sup>(See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/809341/) for an explanation of why this works and is actually the best approach.)</sup>

# Using std::bitset

    std::bitset<10> x;
    x.set(); // Sets all bits to '1'

## Remove rightmost set bit
# C-style bit-manipulation

    template <typename T>
    T rightmostSetBitRemoved(T n)
    {
        // static_assert(std::is_integral<T>::value && !std::is_signed<T>::value, "type should be unsigned"); // For c++11 and later
        return n & (n - 1);
    }

**Explanation**

- if `n` is zero, we have `0 & 0xFF..FF` which is zero
- else `n` can be written `0bxxxxxx10..00` and `n - 1` is `0bxxxxxx011..11`, so `n & (n - 1)` is `0bxxxxxx000..00`.


## Setting a bit
# C-style bit manipulation
A bit can be set using the bitwise OR operator (`|`).

    // Bit x will be set
    number |= 1LL << x; 

# Using std::bitset

`set(x)` or `set(x,true)` - sets bit at position `x` to `1`.

    std::bitset<5> num(std::string("01100"));
    num.set(0);      // num is now 01101
    num.set(2);      // num is still 01101
    num.set(4,true); // num is now 11110

## Clearing a bit
# C-style bit-manipulation
A bit can be cleared using the bitwise AND operator (`&`).

    // Bit x will be cleared
    number &= ~(1LL << x);

# Using std::bitset
`reset(x)` or `set(x,false)` - clears the bit at position `x`.

    std::bitset<5> num(std::string("01100"));
    num.reset(2);     // num is now 01000
    num.reset(0);     // num is still 01000
    num.set(3,false); // num is now 00000

## Changing the nth bit to x
# C-style bit-manipulation

    // Bit n will be set if x is 1 and cleared if x is 0.
    number ^= (-x ^ number) & (1LL << n);

# Using std::bitset
`set(n,val)` - sets bit `n` to the value `val`.

    std::bitset<5> num(std::string("00100"));
    num.set(0,true);  // num is now 00101
    num.set(2,false); // num is now 00001

## Counting bits set
The population count of a bitstring is often needed in cryptography and other applications and the problem has been widely studied.

The naive way requires one iteration per bit:

    unsigned value = 1234;
    unsigned bits = 0;  // accumulates the total number of bits set in `n`

    for (bits = 0; value; value >>= 1)
      bits += value & 1;

---

A nice trick (based on <https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%2b%2b/3016/bit-manipulation/17299/remove-rightmost-set-bit> ) is:

    unsigned bits = 0;  // accumulates the total number of bits set in `n`

    for (; value; ++bits)
      value &= value - 1;

It goes through as many iterations as there are set bits, so it's good when `value` is expected to have few nonzero bits.

The method was first proposed by Peter Wegner (in [CACM][1] 3 / 322 - 1960) and it's well known since it appears in *C Programming Language* by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

---

This requires 12 arithmetic operations, one of which is a multication:

    unsigned popcount(std::uint64_t x)
    {
      const std::uint64_t m1  = 0x5555555555555555;  // binary: 0101...
      const std::uint64_t m2  = 0x3333333333333333;  // binary: 00110011..
      const std::uint64_t m4  = 0x0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f;  // binary: 0000111100001111

      x -= (x >> 1) & m1;             // put count of each 2 bits into those 2 bits
      x = (x & m2) + ((x >> 2) & m2); // put count of each 4 bits into those 4 bits 
      x = (x + (x >> 4)) & m4;        // put count of each 8 bits into those 8 bits 
      return (x * h01) >> 56;  // left 8 bits of x + (x<<8) + (x<<16) + (x<<24) + ... 
    }

This kind of implementation has the best worst-case behavior (see [Hamming weight][2] for further details).

---

Many CPUs have a specific instruction (like x86's `popcnt`) and the compiler could offer a specific (**non standard**) built in function. E.g. with g++ there is:

    int __builtin_popcount (unsigned x);

## Check if an integer is a power of 2
The `n & (n - 1)` trick (see <https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%2b%2b/3016/bit-manipulation/17299/remove-rightmost-set-bit>) is also useful to determine if an integer is a power of 2:

    bool power_of_2 = n && !(n & (n - 1));

Note that without the first part of the check (`n &&`), `0` is incorrectly considered a power of 2.

## Bit Manipulation Application: Small to Capital  Letter
One of several applications of bit manipulation is converting a letter from small to capital or vice versa by choosing a **mask** and a proper **bit operation**. For example, the **a** letter has this binary representation `01(1)00001` while its capital counterpart has `01(0)00001`. They differ solely in the bit in parenthesis. In this case, converting the **a** letter from small to capital is basically setting the bit in parenthesis to one. To do so, we do the following:

    /****************************************
    convert small letter to captial letter.
    ========================================
         a: 01100001
      mask: 11011111  <-- (0xDF)  11(0)11111
          :---------
    a&mask: 01000001  <-- A letter
    *****************************************/

The code for converting a letter to A letter is 

    #include <cstdio>
    
    int main()
    {
        char op1 = 'a';  // "a" letter (i.e. small case)
        int mask = 0xDF; // choosing a proper mask
    
        printf("a (AND) mask = A\n");
        printf("%c   &   0xDF = %c\n", op1, op1 & mask);
        
        return 0;
    }

The result is 

    $ g++ main.cpp -o test1
    $ ./test1
    a (AND) mask = A
    a   &   0xDF = A
