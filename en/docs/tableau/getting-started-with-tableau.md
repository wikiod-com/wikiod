## What is Tableau?
[Tableau][1] is a family of interactive data visualization products focused on Business Intelligence, varying from Tableau Server, aimed for enterprises who want to share dashboards and data across departments, to Tableau Public, that anyone can use for free and publish their dashboards on-line.

Independently of the product version, one will use the proprietary Tableau platform to create dynamic views and dashboards. They also provide a different set of APIs, such as the [JavaScript API][2] that lets you integrate the visualizations into your web apps, create custom interactions and behaviors, and more.
