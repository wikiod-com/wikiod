AWS Lambda is a serverless setup for executing functions in the cloud. It leverages existing Amazon Web Services technologies to infinitely scale and run only when necessary in it's own isolated environment. Using Lambda, you can upload your code, configure it to run based on a variety of triggers, and then automatically decommission the process when complete. It operates on a pay-per-use model and is extremely cost effective and easy to scale.

----------

**AWS Lambda supports code written in Node.js (JavaScript), Python, Java (Java 8 compatible) and C# (.NET Core). Your code can include existing libraries, even native ones.**

**Triggers can include:**
=========================

 HTTP Endpoints
- Mobile Apps
- Other AWS Services (Including REST implementation with Amazon API Gateway)

========================================================================

- File processing of uploads
  - Transcoding
  - Indexing
