Dart is an open-source, class-based, optionally-typed programming language for building web applications--on both the client and server--created by Google. Dartâ€™s design goals are:

 - Create a structured yet flexible language for web programming.
 - Make Dart feel familiar and natural to programmers and thus easy to learn.
 - Ensure that Dart delivers high performance on all modern web browsers and environments ranging from small handheld devices to server-side execution.

Dart targets a wide range of development scenarios, from a one-person project without much structure to a large-scale project needing formal types in the code to state programmer intent. 

To support this wide range of projects, Dart provides the following features and tools:

 - **Optional types:** this means you can start coding without types and add them later as needed. 
 - **Isolates:** concurrent programming on server and client
 - **Easy DOM access:** using CSS selectors (the same way that jQuery does it)
 - **Dart IDE Tools:** Dart plugins exist for many commonly used IDEs, Ex: [WebStorm](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/webstorm).
 - **Dartium:** a build of the Chromium Web Browser with a built-in Dart Virtual Machine
