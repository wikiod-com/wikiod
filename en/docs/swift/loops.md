## For-in loop
The **for-in** loop allows you to iterate over any sequence.

## Iterating over a range

You can iterate over both half-open and closed ranges:

    for i in 0..<3 {
        print(i)
    }

    for i in 0...2 {
        print(i)
    }

    // Both print:
    // 0
    // 1
    // 2

## Iterating over an array or set

    let names = ["James", "Emily", "Miles"]

    for name in names {
       print(name)
    }

    // James
    // Emily
    // Miles

<!-- if version [eq 2.1] [eq 2.2] -->

If you need the index for each element in the array, you can use the [`enumerate()`][1] method on [`SequenceType`][2].

    for (index, name) in names.enumerate() {
       print("The index of \(name) is \(index).")
    }

    // The index of James is 0.
    // The index of Emily is 1.
    // The index of Miles is 2.

`enumerate()` returns a lazy sequence containing pairs of elements with consecutive `Int`s, starting from 0. Therefore with arrays, these numbers will correspond to the given index of each element â€“ however this may not be the case with other kinds of collections.

<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [gte 3.0] -->

In Swift 3, `enumerate()` has been renamed to [`enumerated()`][3]:

    for (index, name) in names.enumerated() {
       print("The index of \(name) is \(index).")
    }

<!-- end version if -->


## Iterating over a dictionary

    let ages = ["James": 29, "Emily": 24]

    for (name, age) in ages {
        print(name, "is", age, "years old.")
    }

    // Emily is 24 years old.
    // James is 29 years old.

## Iterating in reverse

<!-- if version [eq 2.1] [eq 2.2] -->

You can use the [`reverse()`][4] method on [`SequenceType`][2] in order to iterate over any sequence in reverse:

    for i in (0..<3).reverse() {
        print(i)
    }
    
    for i in (0...2).reverse() {
        print(i)
    }

    // Both print:
    // 2
    // 1
    // 0

    let names = ["James", "Emily", "Miles"]
    
    for name in names.reverse() {
        print(name)
    }
    
    // Miles
    // Emily
    // James

<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [gte 3.0] -->

In Swift 3, `reverse()` has been renamed to [`reversed()`][5]:

    for i in (0..<3).reversed() {
        print(i)
    }

<!-- end version if -->

## Iterating over ranges with custom stride

<!-- if version [eq 2.1] [eq 2.2] -->

By using the [`stride(_:_:)`][7] methods on [`Strideable`][8] you can iterate over a range with a custom stride:

    for i in 4.stride(to: 0, by: -2) {
        print(i)
    }

    // 4
    // 2

    for i in 4.stride(through: 0, by: -2) {
        print(i)
    }

    // 4
    // 2
    // 0

<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [eq 1.2] [gte 3.0] -->

In Swift 3, the `stride(_:_:)` methods on `Stridable` have been replaced by the global [`stride(_:_:_:)`][9] functions:

    for i in stride(from: 4, to: 0, by: -2) {
        print(i)
    }

    for i in stride(from: 4, through: 0, by: -2) {
        print(i)
    }

<!-- end version if -->

## Repeat-while loop
Similar to the while loop, only the control statement is evaluated after the loop. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once.

    var i: Int = 0

    repeat {
       print(i)
       i += 1
    } while i < 3

    // 0
    // 1
    // 2

## For-in loop with filtering
1. **`where`** clause

By adding a `where` clause you can restrict the iterations to ones that satisfy the given condition.

    for i in 0..<5 where i % 2 == 0 {
        print(i)
    }

    // 0
    // 2
    // 4


    let names = ["James", "Emily", "Miles"]

    for name in names where name.characters.contains("s") {
        print(name)
    }

    // James
    // Miles

2. **`case`** clause

It's useful when you need to iterate only through the values that match some pattern: 

    let points = [(5, 0), (31, 0), (5, 31)]
    for case (_, 0) in points {
        print("point on x-axis")
    }

    //point on x-axis
    //point on x-axis

Also you can filter optional values and unwrap them if appropriate by adding `?` mark after binding constant:

    let optionalNumbers = [31, 5, nil]
    for case let number? in optionalNumbers {
        print(number)
    }

    //31    
    //5

## Sequence Type forEach block
A type that conforms to the SequenceType protocol can iterate through it's elements within a closure:

    collection.forEach { print($0) }

The same could also be done with a named parameter:

    collection.forEach { item in
        print(item)
    }

*Note: Control flow statements (such as break or continue) may not be used in these blocks. A return can be called, and if called, will immediately return the block for the current iteration (much like a continue would). The next iteration will then execute. 

    let arr = [1,2,3,4]
    
    arr.forEach {
        
        // blocks for 3 and 4 will still be called
        if $0 == 2 {
            return
        }
    }

## while loop
A `while` loop will execute as long as the condition is true.
    
    var count = 1
    
    while count < 10 {
        print("This is the \(count) run of the loop")
        count += 1
    }

## Breaking a loop
A loop will execute as long as its condition remains true, but you can stop it manually using the **`break`** keyword. For example:

    var peopleArray = ["John", "Nicole", "Thomas", "Richard", "Brian", "Novak", "Vick", "Amanda", "Sonya"]
    var positionOfNovak = 0

    for person in peopleArray {
        if person == "Novak" { break }
        positionOfNovak += 1
    }

    print("Novak is the element located on position [\(positionOfNovak)] in peopleArray.")
    //prints out: Novak is the element located on position 5 in peopleArray. (which is true)
