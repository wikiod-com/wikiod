Some examples in this topic might have a different order when used because dictionary order is not guaranteed.


## Declaring Dictionaries
Dictionaries are an unordered collection of keys and values. Values relate to unique keys and must be of the same type.

When initializing a Dictionary the full syntax is as follows:

    var books : Dictionary<Int, String> = Dictionary<Int, String>()

Although a more concise way of initializing:

    var books = [Int: String]()
    // or
    var books: [Int: String] = [:]
    
Declare a dictionary with keys and values by specifying them in a comma separated list. The types can be inferred from the types of keys and values.

    var books: [Int: String] = [1: "Book 1", 2: "Book 2"]
    //books = [2: "Book 2", 1: "Book 1"] 
    var otherBooks = [3: "Book 3", 4: "Book 4"]
    //otherBooks = [3: "Book 3", 4: "Book 4"]



## Accessing Values
A value in a `Dictionary` can be accessed using its key:

    var books: [Int: String] = [1: "Book 1", 2: "Book 2"]
    let bookName = books[1]
    //bookName = "Book 1"

The values of a dictionary can be iterated through using the `values` property:

    for book in books.values {
        print("Book Title: \(book)")
    }
    //output: Book Title: Book 2
    //output: Book Title: Book 1

Similarly, the keys of a dictionary can be iterated through using its `keys` property:

    for bookNumbers in books.keys {
        print("Book number: \(bookNumber)")
    }
    // outputs:
    // Book number: 1
    // Book number: 2

To get all `key` and `value` pair corresponding to each other (you will not get in proper order since it is a Dictionary)

    for (book,bookNumbers)in books{
    print("\(book)  \(bookNumbers)")
    }
    // outputs:
    // 2  Book 2
    // 1  Book 1

Note that a `Dictionary`, unlike an `Array`, in inherently unordered-that is, there is no guarantee on the order during iteration.

If you want to access multiple levels of a Dictionary use a repeated subscript syntax.

    // Create a multilevel dictionary.
    var myDictionary: [String:[Int:String]]! = ["Toys":[1:"Car",2:"Truck"],"Interests":[1:"Science",2:"Math"]]
    
    print(myDictionary["Toys"][2]) // Outputs "Truck"
    print(myDictionary["Interests"][1]) // Outputs "Science"

## Change Value of Dictionary using Key
    var dict = ["name": "John", "surname": "Doe"]
    // Set the element with key: 'name' to 'Jane'
    dict["name"] = "Jane"
    print(dict)

## Modifying Dictionaries
Add a key and value to a Dictionary

    var books = [Int: String]()
    //books = [:]
    books[5] = "Book 5"
    //books = [5: "Book 5"]
    books.updateValue("Book 6", forKey: 5)
    //[5: "Book 6"]

updateValue returns the original value if one exists or nil.

    let previousValue = books.updateValue("Book 7", forKey: 5)
    //books = [5: "Book 7"]
    //previousValue = "Book 6"
Remove value and their keys with similar syntax

    books[5] = nil
    //books [:]
    books[6] = "Deleting from Dictionaries"
    //books = [6: "Deleting from Dictionaries"]
    let removedBook = books.removeValueForKey(6)
    //books = [:]
    //removedValue = "Deleting from Dictionaries"

## Get all keys in Dictionary
    let myAllKeys = ["name" : "Kirit" , "surname" : "Modi"]
    let allKeys = Array(myAllKeys.keys)
    print(allKeys)

## Merge two dictionaries
    extension Dictionary {
        func merge(dict: Dictionary<Key,Value>) -> Dictionary<Key,Value> {
            var mutableCopy = self
            for (key, value) in dict {
                // If both dictionaries have a value for same key, the value of the other dictionary is used.
                mutableCopy[key] = value
            }
            return mutableCopy
        }
    }
