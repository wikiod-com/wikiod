Algorithms are a backbone to computing. Making a choice of which algorithm to use in which situation distinguishes an average from good programmer. With that in mind, here are definitions and code examples of some of the basic algorithms out there.

## Sorting
**Bubble Sort**

This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed.
Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems. It has complexity of O(n2) but it is considered slower than insertion sort.


    extension Array where Element: Comparable {

    func bubbleSort() -> Array<Element> {
        
        //check for trivial case
        guard self.count > 1 else {
            return self
        }
        
        //mutated copy
        var output: Array<Element> = self
        
        for primaryIndex in 0..<self.count {
            let passes = (output.count - 1) - primaryIndex
            
            //"half-open" range operator
            for secondaryIndex in 0..<passes {
                let key = output[secondaryIndex]
                
                //compare / swap positions
                if (key > output[secondaryIndex + 1]) {
                    swap(&output[secondaryIndex], &output[secondaryIndex + 1])
                }
            }
        }
        
        return output
    }

    }



**Insertion sort**

Insertion sort is one of the more basic algorithms in computer science. The insertion sort ranks elements by iterating through a collection and positions elements based on their value. The set is divided into sorted and unsorted halves and repeats until all elements are sorted.
Insertion sort has complexity of O(n2).
You can put it in an extension, like in an example below, or you can create a method for it.

    extension Array where Element: Comparable {
    
    func insertionSort() -> Array<Element> {
        
        //check for trivial case
        guard self.count > 1 else {
            return self
        }
        
        //mutated copy
        var output: Array<Element> = self
        
        for primaryindex in 0..<output.count {
            
            let key = output[primaryindex]
            var secondaryindex = primaryindex
            
            while secondaryindex > -1 {
                if key < output[secondaryindex] {
                    
                    //move to correct position
                    output.remove(at: secondaryindex + 1)
                    output.insert(key, at: secondaryindex)
                }
                secondaryindex -= 1
            }
        }
        
        return output
    }
    }


**Selection sort** 

Selection sort is noted for its simplicity. It starts with the first element in the array, saving it's value as a minimum value (or maximum, depending on sorting order). It then itterates through the array, and replaces the min value with any other value lesser then min it finds on the way. That min value is then placed at the leftmost part of the array and the process is repeated, from the next index, until the end of the array. Selection sort has complexity of O(n2) but it is considered slower than it's counterpart - Selection sort.

func selectionSort() -> Array<Element> {
    //check for trivial case
    guard self.count > 1 else {
        return self
    }
     
    //mutated copy
    var output: Array<Element> = self
     
    for primaryindex in 0..<output.count {
        var minimum = primaryindex
        var secondaryindex = primaryindex + 1
         
        while secondaryindex < output.count {
            //store lowest value as minimum
            if output[minimum] > output[secondaryindex] {
                minimum = secondaryindex
            }
            secondaryindex += 1
        }
         
        //swap minimum value with array iteration
        if primaryindex != minimum {
            swap(&output[primaryindex], &output[minimum])
        }
    }
     
    return output 
    }



**Quick Sort - O(n log n) complexity time**

Quicksort is one of the advanced algorithms. It features a time complexity of O(n log n) and applies a divide & conquer strategy. This combination results in advanced algorithmic performance. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays.

The steps are:

Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array.

Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.

Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.

mutating func quickSort() -> Array<Element> {

    func qSort(start startIndex: Int, _ pivot: Int) {
        
        if (startIndex < pivot) {
            let iPivot = qPartition(start: startIndex, pivot)
            qSort(start: startIndex, iPivot - 1)
            qSort(start: iPivot + 1, pivot)
        }
    }
    qSort(start: 0, self.endIndex - 1)
    return self
    }
    
    mutating func qPartition(start startIndex: Int, _ pivot: Int) -> Int {
    
    var wallIndex: Int = startIndex
    
    //compare range with pivot
    for currentIndex in wallIndex..<pivot {
        
        if self[currentIndex] <= self[pivot] {
            if wallIndex != currentIndex {
                swap(&self[currentIndex], &self[wallIndex])
            }
            
            //advance wall
            wallIndex += 1
        }
    }
        //move pivot to final position
        if wallIndex != pivot {
            swap(&self[wallIndex], &self[pivot])
        }
        return wallIndex
    }

        }
        
        //mutated copy
        var output: Array<Element> = self
        
        for primaryindex in 0..<output.count {
            
            let key = output[primaryindex]
            var secondaryindex = primaryindex
            
            while secondaryindex > -1 {
                if key < output[secondaryindex] {
                    
                    //move to correct position
                    output.remove(at: secondaryindex + 1)
                    output.insert(key, at: secondaryindex)
                }
                secondaryindex -= 1

        var output: Array<Element> = self
         
        for primaryindex in 0..<output.count {
            var minimum = primaryindex
            var secondaryindex = primaryindex + 1
             
            while secondaryindex < output.count {
                //store lowest value as minimum
                if output[minimum] > output[secondaryindex] {
                    minimum = secondaryindex
                }
                secondaryindex += 1

            }
        }
         
        return output
    }

## Asymptotic analysis
Since we have many different algorithms to choose from, when we want to sort an array, we need to know which one will do it's job. So we need some method of measuring algoritm's speed and reliability. That's where Asymptotic analysis kicks in.
Asymptotic analysis is the process of describing the efficiency of algorithms as their input size (n) grows. In computer science, asymptotics are usually expressed in a common format known as Big O Notation.

 - **Linear time O(n)**: When each item in the array has to be evaluated in order for a function to achieve it's goal, that means that the function becomes less efficent as number of elements is increasing. *A function like this is said to run in linear time because its speed is dependent on its input size.*
 - **Polynominal time O(n2)**: If complexity of a function grows exponentialy (meaning that for n elements of an array complexity of a function is n squared) that function operates in polynominal time. These are usually functions with nested loops. Two nested loops result in O(n2) complexity, three nested loops result in O(n3) complexity, and so on...
 - **Logarithmic time O(log n):** Logarithmic time functions's complexity is minimized when the size of its inputs (n) grows. These are the type of functions every programmer strives for. 

## Quick Sort - O(n log n) complexity time
Quicksort is one of the advanced algorithms. It features a time complexity of O(n log n) and applies a divide & conquer strategy. This combination results in advanced algorithmic performance. Quicksort first divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays.

 2. Reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.
 3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of elements with greater values.

        mutating func quickSort() -> Array<Element> {
        
        func qSort(start startIndex: Int, _ pivot: Int) {
            
            if (startIndex < pivot) {
                let iPivot = qPartition(start: startIndex, pivot)
                qSort(start: startIndex, iPivot - 1)
                qSort(start: iPivot + 1, pivot)
            }
        }
        qSort(start: 0, self.endIndex - 1)
        return self
        
    }

    mutating func qPartition(start startIndex: Int, _ pivot: Int) -> Int {
        
        var wallIndex: Int = startIndex
        
        //compare range with pivot
        for currentIndex in wallIndex..<pivot {
            
            if self[currentIndex] <= self[pivot] {
                if wallIndex != currentIndex {
                    swap(&self[currentIndex], &self[wallIndex])
                }
                
                //advance wall
                wallIndex += 1
            }
        }
        
        
        //move pivot to final position
        if wallIndex != pivot {
            swap(&self[wallIndex], &self[pivot])
        }
        return wallIndex
    }



## Graph, Trie, Stack
**Graph**
-----

In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics.
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.
A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge value, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.). (Wikipedia, [source][1])

**Trie**
----

In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings.

**Stack**
-----

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.
