## Syntax
 - Mirror(reflecting: instance) // Initializes a mirror with the subject to reflect
 - mirror.displayStyle // Display style used for Xcode playgrounds
 - mirror.description // Textual representation of this instance, see [CustomStringConvertible](http://swiftdoc.org/v3.0/protocol/CustomStringConvertible/)
 - mirror.subjectType // Returns the type of the subject being reflected
 - mirror.superclassMirror // Returns the mirror of the super-class of the subject being reflected

1. ***General Remarks:***

A `Mirror` is a `struct` used in the introspection of an object in Swift. Its most prominent property is the children array. One possible use case is to serialize a struct for `Core Data`. This is done by converting a `struct` into a `NSManagedObject`.

2. ***Basic Usage for Mirror Remarks:***

The `children` property of a `Mirror` is an array of child objects from the object the Mirror instance is reflecting. A `child` object has two properties `label` and `value`. For example a child might be a property with the name `title` and the value of `Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire`.  


## Basic Usage for Mirror
   Creating the class to be the subject of the Mirror

    class Project {
        var title: String = ""
        var id: Int = 0
        var platform: String = ""
        var version: Int = 0
        var info: String?
    }
    
Creating an instance that will actually be the subject of the mirror. Also here you can add values to the properties of the Project class. 

    let sampleProject = Project()
    sampleProject.title = "MirrorMirror"
    sampleProject.id = 199
    sampleProject.platform = "iOS"
    sampleProject.version = 2
    sampleProject.info = "test app for Reflection"
    
The code below shows the creating of Mirror instance. The children property of the mirror is a `AnyForwardCollection<Child>` where `Child` is typealias tuple for  subject's property and value. `Child` had a `label: String` and `value: Any`.  

    let projectMirror = Mirror(reflecting: sampleProject)
    let properties = projectMirror.children
    
    print(properties.count)        //5
    print(properties.first?.label) //Optional("title")
    print(properties.first!.value) //MirrorMirror
    print()
    
    for property in properties {
        print("\(property.label!):\(property.value)")
    }

    
   Output in Playground or Console in Xcode for the for loop above. 
    
    title:MirrorMirror
    id:199
    platform:iOS
    version:2
    info:Optional("test app for Reflection")

*Tested in Playground on Xcode 8 beta 2*

## Getting type and names of properties for a class without having to instantiate it
Using the Swift class `Mirror` works if you want to extract *name*, *value* and *type* (Swift 3: `type(of: value)`, Swift 2: `value.dynamicType`) of properties for an **instance** of a certain class.

If you class inherits from `NSObject`, you can use the method `class_copyPropertyList` together with `property_getAttributes` to find out the *name* and *types* of properties for a class - **without having an instance of it**. I created a project on [Github](https://github.com/Sajjon/SwiftReflection) for this, but here is the code:

    func getTypesOfProperties(in clazz: NSObject.Type) -> Dictionary<String, Any>? {
        var count = UInt32()
        guard let properties = class_copyPropertyList(clazz, &count) else { return nil }
        var types: Dictionary<String, Any> = [:]
        for i in 0..<Int(count) {
            guard let property: objc_property_t = properties[i], let name = getNameOf(property: property) else { continue }
            let type = getTypeOf(property: property)
            types[name] = type
        }
        free(properties)
        return types
    }

    func getTypeOf(property: objc_property_t) -> Any {
        guard let attributesAsNSString: NSString = NSString(utf8String: property_getAttributes(property)) else { return Any.self }
        let attributes = attributesAsNSString as String
        let slices = attributes.components(separatedBy: "\"")
        guard slices.count > 1 else { return getPrimitiveDataType(withAttributes: attributes) }
        let objectClassName = slices[1]
        let objectClass = NSClassFromString(objectClassName) as! NSObject.Type
        return objectClass
    }
        
       func getPrimitiveDataType(withAttributes attributes: String) -> Any {
            guard let letter = attributes.substring(from: 1, to: 2), let type = primitiveDataTypes[letter] else { return Any.self }
            return type
        }

Where `primitiveDataTypes` is a Dictionary mapping a letter in the attribute string to a value type:

    let primitiveDataTypes: Dictionary<String, Any> = [
        "c" : Int8.self,
        "s" : Int16.self,
        "i" : Int32.self,
        "q" : Int.self, //also: Int64, NSInteger, only true on 64 bit platforms
        "S" : UInt16.self,
        "I" : UInt32.self,
        "Q" : UInt.self, //also UInt64, only true on 64 bit platforms
        "B" : Bool.self,
        "d" : Double.self,
        "f" : Float.self,
        "{" : Decimal.self
    ]
        
       func getNameOf(property: objc_property_t) -> String? {
            guard let name: NSString = NSString(utf8String: property_getName(property)) else { return nil }
            return name as String
        }

It can extract the `NSObject.Type` of all properties which class type inherits from `NSObject` such as `NSDate` (Swift3: `Date`), `NSString`(Swift3: `String`?) and `NSNumber`, however it is store in the type `Any` (as you can see as the type of the value of the Dictionary returned by the method). This is due to the limitations of `value types` such as Int, Int32, Bool. Since those types do not inherit from NSObject, calling `.self` on e.g. an Int - `Int.self` does not return NSObject.Type, but rather the type `Any`. Thus the method returns `Dictionary<String, Any>?` and not `Dictionary<String, NSObject.Type>?`. 

You can use this method like this:

    class Book: NSObject {
        let title: String
        let author: String?
        let numberOfPages: Int
        let released: Date
        let isPocket: Bool
    
        init(title: String, author: String?, numberOfPages: Int, released: Date, isPocket: Bool) {
            self.title = title
            self.author = author
            self.numberOfPages = numberOfPages
            self.released = released
            self.isPocket = isPocket
        }
    }
    
    guard let types = getTypesOfProperties(in: Book.self) else { return }
    for (name, type) in types {
        print("'\(name)' has type '\(type)'")
    }
    // Prints:
    // 'title' has type 'NSString'
    // 'numberOfPages' has type 'Int'
    // 'author' has type 'NSString'
    // 'released' has type 'NSDate'
    // 'isPocket' has type 'Bool'

You can also try to cast the `Any` to `NSObject.Type`, which will succeed for all properties inheriting from `NSObject`, then you can check the type using standard `==` operator:


    func checkPropertiesOfBook() {
        guard let types = getTypesOfProperties(in: Book.self) else { return }
        for (name, type) in types {
            if let objectType = type as? NSObject.Type {
                if objectType == NSDate.self {
                    print("Property named '\(name)' has type 'NSDate'")
                } else if objectType == NSString.self {
                    print("Property named '\(name)' has type 'NSString'")
                }
            }
        }
    }

If you declare this custom `==` operator:

    func ==(rhs: Any, lhs: Any) -> Bool {
        let rhsType: String = "\(rhs)"
        let lhsType: String = "\(lhs)"
        let same = rhsType == lhsType
        return same
    }

You can then even check the type of `value types` like this:


    func checkPropertiesOfBook() {
        guard let types = getTypesOfProperties(in: Book.self) else { return }
        for (name, type) in types {
            if type == Int.self {
                print("Property named '\(name)' has type 'Int'")
            } else if type == Bool.self {
                print("Property named '\(name)' has type 'Bool'")
            }
        }
    }




**LIMITATIONS**
This solution does not work when `value types` are optionals. If you have declared a property in you NSObject subclass like this: `var myOptionalInt: Int?`, the code above won't find that property because the method `class_copyPropertyList` does not contain optional value types.
