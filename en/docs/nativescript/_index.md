Nativescript is a highly performant cross-platform mobile app runtime, which allows you to target iOS and android (with windows in the pipeline) using web technologies (JS and html). It was created with a number of key aims:

 - Visually Performant: no UI Jank even on android you have buttery smooth fps
 - Extensible: you have access to all native APIs, to create easy cross platform plugins
 - Completely native UI
 - Highly Integrated with Typescript and Angular 2
 - Open Source, with strong corporate backing from Telerik
