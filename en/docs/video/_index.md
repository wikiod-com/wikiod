Video playback is front and center in a large range of modern solutions, with the software and standards evolving rapidly. To understand this field, you must first understand the multiple aspects involved in working with video:

* Raw color information captured from the physical world is commonly *encoded* using a codec - an algorithm whose purpose is to represent this data in a compressed form, often sacrificing some visual detail in favor of greater compression.
* For playback, the inverse algorithm is executed - the data is *decoded* to once again become raw color information that can be supplied to an output device (e.g. a monitor).
* Between encoding and decoding, the compressed data is *packaged* for storage, which may involve combining tracks of different types into a single file or the segmentation of content into a large number of small segments.
* The video is *delivered* to the end-user's device using a delivery technology, which can be as simple as a file download over HTTP or considerably more complex, involving live feedback from the network infrastructure and automatic adaptation of quality levels.
* Premium content is usually *encrypted* before packaging and can only be played back in a player equipped with a DRM technology that ensures decryption key security during use and actively protects against output capture.

While the visual portion is obviously dominant in visibility, audio and text also play a key role in media presentations, providing multilanguage features that make content accessible to a wide audience. In most workflows, audio and text tracks are handled in a manner equivalent to video tracks, being encoded, decoded, packaged and delivered along the same lines.

All of these aspects - and more - must be cared for in a modern solution, ensuring a pleasant experience for the end-users.
