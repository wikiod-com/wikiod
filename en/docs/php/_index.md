**[PHP][2]** (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source programming language. It is especially suited for web development. The unique thing about PHP is that it serves both beginners as well as experienced developers. It has a low barrier to entry so it is easy to get started with, and at the same time, it provides advanced features offered in other programming languages.

**Open-Source**

It's an open-source project. Feel free to [get involved][4].

**Language Specification**

PHP has a [language specification][3]. 

**Supported Versions**

Currently, there are three [supported versions][5]: 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1. 

Each release branch of PHP is fully supported for two years from its initial stable release. After this two year period of active support, each branch is then supported for an additional year for critical security issues only. Releases during this period are made on an as-needed basis: there may be multiple point releases, or none, depending on the number of reports.

**Unsupported Versions**

Once the three years of support are completed, the branch reaches its end of life and is no longer supported. 

A [table of end of life branches][6] is available.

**Issue Tracker**

Bugs and other issues are tracked at https://bugs.php.net/.

**Mailing Lists**

Discussions about PHP development and usage are held on the [PHP mailing lists][7].

Please help to maintain or to translate the [official PHP documentation][8].
