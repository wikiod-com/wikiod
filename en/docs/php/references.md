## Syntax
 - `$foo = 1; $bar = &$foo; // both $foo and $bar point to the same value: 1`
 - `$var = 1; function calc(&$var) { $var *= 15; } calc($var); echo $var;`

While assigning two variables by reference, both variables point to the same value. Take the following example:

    $foo = 1;
    $bar = &$foo;

`$foo` ***does not*** point to `$bar`. `$foo` and `$bar` both point to the same value of `$foo`, which is `1`. To illustrate:

    $baz = &$bar;
    unset($bar);
    $baz++;

If we had a `points to` relationship, this would be broken now after the `unset()`; instead, `$foo` and `$baz` still point to the same value, which is `2`.

## Assign by Reference
This is the first phase of referencing. Essentially when you [assign by reference][1], you're allowing two variables to share the same value as such.

    $foo = &$bar;

`$foo` and `$bar` are equal here. They **do not** point to one another. They point to the same place (*the "value"*).

----

You can also assign by reference within the *`array()`* language construct. While not strictly being an assignment by reference.


    $foo = 'hi';
    $bar = array(1, 2);
    $array = array(&$foo, &$bar[0]);

> **Note**, however, that references inside arrays are potentially
> dangerous. Doing a normal (not by reference) assignment with a
> reference on the right side does not turn the left side into a

Assigning by reference is not only limited to variables and arrays, they are also present for functions and all "pass-by-reference" associations.

    function incrementArray(&$arr) {
        foreach ($arr as &$val) {
            $val++;
        }
    }
    
    function &getArray() {
        static $arr = [1, 2, 3];
        return $arr;
    }
    
    incrementArray(getArray());
    var_dump(getArray()); // prints an array [2, 3, 4]

Assignment is key within the function definition as above. You **can not** pass an expression by reference, only a value/variable. Hence the instantiation of `$a` in `bar()`.

## Return by Reference
Occasionally there comes time for you to implicitly return-by-reference.

> Returning by reference is useful when you want to use a function to
> find to which variable a reference should be bound. Do not use
> return-by-reference to increase performance. The engine will
> automatically optimize this on its own. Only return references when
> you have a valid technical reason to do so.

<sup>*Taken from the [PHP Documentation for Returning By Reference][1].*</sup>

There are many different forms return by reference can take, including the following example:

    function parent(&$var) {
        echo $var;
        $var = "updated";
    }
    
    function &child() {
        static $a = "test";
        return $a;
    }
    
    parent(child()); // returns "test"
    parent(child()); // returns "updated"


Return by reference is not only limited to function references. You also have the ability to implicitly call the function:

    function &myFunction() {
        static $a = 'foo';
        return $a;
    }
    
    $bar = &myFunction();
    $bar = "updated"
    echo myFunction();

You cannot directly _reference_ a function call, it has to be assigned to a variable before harnessing it. To see how that works, simply try `echo &myFunction();`.

-----

# Notes #

 - You are required to specify a reference (`&`) in both places you intend on using it. That means, for your function definition (`function &myFunction() {...`) and in the calling reference (`function callFunction(&$variable) {...` or `&myFunction();`).
 - You can only return a variable by reference. Hence the instantiation of `$a` in the example above. This means you can not return an expression, otherwise an **`E_NOTICE`** PHP error will be generated (*`Notice:  Only variable references should be returned by reference in ......`*).
 - Return by reference does have legitimate use cases, but I should warn that they should be used sparingly, only after exploring all other potential options of achieving the same goal.

## Pass by Reference
This allows you to pass a variable by reference to a function or element that allows you to modify the original variable. 

Passing-by-reference is not limited to variables only, the following can also be passed by reference:

 - New statements, e.g. `foo(new SomeClass)`
 - References returned from functions

---

# Arrays #

A common use of ["passing-by-reference"][1] is to modify initial values within an array without going to the extent of creating new arrays or littering your namespace. Passing-by-reference is as simple as preceding/prefixing the variable with an `&` => `&$myElement`.

Below is an example of harnessing an element from an array and simply adding 1 to its initial value.

    $arr = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    
    foreach($arr as &$num) {
        $num++;
    }

Now when you harness any element within `$arr`, the original element will be updated as the reference was increased. You can verify this by:

    print_r($arr);

> **Note**
>
> You should take note when harnessing pass by reference within loops. At the end of the above loop, `$num` still holds a reference to the last element of the array. Assigning it post loop will end up manipulating the last array element! You can ensure this doesn't happen by `unset()`'ing it post-loop:
> 
>     $myArray = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
>
>     foreach($myArray as &$num) {
>        $num++;
>     }
>     unset($num);
> The above will ensure you don't run into any issues. An example of issues that could relate from this is present in [this question on StackOverflow][2].


---

# Functions #

Another common usage for passing-by-reference is within functions. Modifying the original variable is as simple as:

    $var = 5;
    // define
    function add(&$var) {
        $var++;
    }
    // call
    add($var);

Which can be verified by `echo`'ing the original variable.

    echo $var;


There are various restrictions around functions, as noted below from the PHP docs:

> **Note:** There is no reference sign on a function call - only on function
> definitions. Function definitions alone are enough to correctly pass
> the argument by reference. As of PHP 5.3.0, you will get a warning
> saying that "call-time pass-by-reference" is deprecated when you use &
> in foo(&$a);. And as of PHP 5.4.0, call-time pass-by-reference was
> removed, so using it will raise a fatal error.
