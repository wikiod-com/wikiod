## Connecting to a mailbox
To do anything with an IMAP account you need to connect to it first. To do this you need to specify some required parameters:

 - The server name or IP address of the mail server
 - The port you wish to connect on
     - IMAP is 143 or 993 (secure)
     - POP is 110 or 995 (secure)
     - SMTP is 25 or 465 (secure)
     - NNTP is 119 or 563 (secure)
 - Connection flags (see below)

| Flag | Description | Options | Default |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `/service=service` | Which service to use | imap, pop3, nntp, smtp | imap
| `/user=user` | remote user name for login on the server |
| `/authuser=user` | remote authentication user; if specified this is the user name whose password is used (e.g. administrator) |
| `/anonymous` | remote access as anonymous user |
| `/debug` | record protocol telemetry in application's debug log | | disabled |
| `/secure` | do not transmit a plaintext password over the network | | |
| `/norsh` | do not use rsh or ssh to establish a preauthenticated IMAP session |
| `/ssl` | use the Secure Socket Layer to encrypt the session |
| `/validate-cert` | certificates from TLS/SSL server | | enabled |
| `/novalidate-cert` | do not validate certificates from TLS/SSL server, needed if server uses self-signed certificates. **USE WITH CAUTION** | | disabled |
| `/tls` | force use of start-TLS to encrypt the session, and reject connection to servers that do not support it
| `/notls` | do not do start-TLS to encrypt the session, even with servers that support it
| `/readonly` | request read-only mailbox open (IMAP only; ignored on NNTP, and an error with SMTP and POP3)


Your connection string will look something like this:

    {imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}

Please note that if any of the characters in your connection string is non-ASCII it must be encoded with [utf7_encode($string)](https://php.net/manual/en/function.imap-utf7-encode.php).

To connect to the mailbox, we use the [imap_open](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-open.php) command which returns a resource value pointing to a stream:

    <?php
    $mailbox = imap_open("{imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}", "username", "password");
    if ($mailbox === false) {
        echo "Failed to connect to server";
    }

## Install IMAP extension
To use the [IMAP functions](http://www.php.net/imap) in PHP you'll need to install the IMAP extension:

**Debian/Ubuntu with PHP5**

    sudo apt-get install php5-imap
    sudo php5enmod imap

**Debian/Ubuntu with PHP7**

    sudo apt-get install php7.0-imap

**YUM based distro**

    sudo yum install php-imap
**Mac OS X  with php5.6**

    brew reinstall php56 --with-imap

## List all folders in the mailbox
Once you've connected to your mailbox, you'll want to take a look inside. The first useful command is [imap_list](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-list.php). The first parameter is the resource you acquired from `imap_open`, the second is your mailbox string and the third is a fuzzy search string (`*` is used to match any pattern).

    $folders = imap_list($mailbox, "{imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}", "*");
    if ($folders === false) {
        echo "Failed to list folders in mailbox";
    } else {
        print_r($folders);
    }

The output should look similar to this

    Array
    (
        [0] => {imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}INBOX
        [1] => {imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}INBOX.Sent
        [2] => {imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}INBOX.Drafts
        [3] => {imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}INBOX.Junk
        [4] => {imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}INBOX.Trash
    )

You can use the third parameter to filter these results like this:

    $folders = imap_list($mailbox, "{imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}", "*.Sent");

And now the result only contains entries with `.Sent` in the name:

    Array
    (
        [0] => {imap.example.com:993/imap/tls/secure}INBOX.Sent
    )

**Note**: Using `*` as a fuzzy search will return all matches recursively. If you use `%` it will return only matches in the current folder specified.

## Finding messages in the mailbox
You can return a list of all the messages in a mailbox using [imap_headers](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-headers.php).

    <?php
    $headers = imap_headers($mailbox);

The result is an array of strings with the following pattern:

    [FLAG] [MESSAGE-ID])[DD-MM-YYY] [FROM ADDRESS] [SUBJECT TRUNCATED TO 25 CHAR] ([SIZE] chars)

Here's a sample of what each line could look like:

    A     1)19-Aug-2016 someone@example.com Message Subject (1728 chars)
    D     2)19-Aug-2016 someone@example.com RE: Message Subject (22840 chars)
    U     3)19-Aug-2016 someone@example.com RE: RE: Message Subject (1876 chars)
    N     4)19-Aug-2016 someone@example.com RE: RE: RE: Message Subje (1741 chars)


| Symbol | Flag | Meaning |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| A | Answered | Message has been replied to |
| D | Deleted | Message is deleted (but not removed) |
| F | Flagged | Message is flagged/stared for attention |
| N | New | Message is new and has not been seen |
| R | Recent | Message is new and has been seen |
| U | Unread | Message has not been read |
| X | Draft | Message is a draft |

**Note that this call could take a fair amount of time to run and may return a very large list.**

An alternative is to load individual messages as you need them. Your emails are each assigned an ID from 1 (the oldest) to the value of [`imap_num_msg($mailbox)`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-num-msg.php).

There are a number of functions to access an email directly, but the simplest way is to use
[`imap_header`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.imap-header.php) which returns structured header information:

    <?php
    $header = imap_headerinfo($mailbox , 1);
