Note that calling `session_start()` even if the session has already started will result in a PHP warning.

## session_start() Options
Starting with PHP Sessions we can pass an array with [session-based `php.ini` options][1] to the `session_start` function.

**Example**

    <?php
       if (version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '7.0.0') >= 0) {
           // php >= 7 version
           session_start([
              'cache_limiter' => 'private',
              'read_and_close' => true,
           ]);
       } else {
           // php < 7 version
           session_start();
       }
    ?>

This feature also introduces a new `php.ini` setting named `session.lazy_write`, which defaults to `true` and means that session data is only rewritten, if it changes.

## Session Locking
As we all are aware that PHP writes session data into a file at server side. When a request is made to php script which starts the session via `session_start()`, PHP locks this session file resulting to block/wait other incoming requests for same `session_id` to complete, because of which the other requests will get stuck on `session_start()` until or unless the **session file locked** is not released

The session file remains locked until the script is completed or session is manually closed. To avoid this situation *i.e. to prevent multiple requests getting blocked*, we can start the session and close the session which will release the lock from session file and allow to continue the remaining requests.

    // php < 7.0 
    // start session 
    session_start();
    
    // write data to session
    $_SESSION['id'] = 123; // session file is locked, so other requests are blocked
    
    // close the session, release lock
    session_write_close();

Now one will think if session is closed how we will read the session values, beautify even after session is closed, session is still available. So, we can still read the session data.

    echo $_SESSION['id'];    // will output  123

In **php >= 7.0**, we can have **read_only** session, **read_write** session and **lazy_write** session, so it may not required to use `session_write_close()`

## Manipulating session data
The `$_SESSION` variable is an array, and you can retrieve or manipulate it like a normal array.

    <?php
    // Starting the session
    session_start();

    // Storing the value in session
    $_SESSION['id'] = 342;

    // conditional usage of session values that may have been set in a previous session
    if(!isset($_SESSION["login"])) {
        echo "Please login first";
        exit;
    }
    // now you can use the login safely
    $user = $_SESSION["login"];

    // Getting a value from the session data, or with default value, 
    //     using the Null Coalescing operator in PHP 7
    $name = $_SESSION['name'] ?? 'Anonymous';

Also see https://www.wikiod.com/php/manipulating-an-array for more reference how to work on an array.

Note that if you store an object in a session, it can be retrieved gracefully only if you have an class autoloader or you have loaded the class already. Otherwise, the object will come out as the type `__PHP_Incomplete_Class`, which may later lead to [crashes](http://stackoverflow.com/q/1055728/3990767). See https://www.wikiod.com/php/classes-and-objects#Namespacing and Autoloading about autoloading.

Warning:
-------
Session data can be hijacked.  This is outlined in: _[Pro PHP Security: From Application Security Principles to the Implementation of XSS Defense - Chapter 7: Preventing Session Hijacking][1]_ So it can be strongly recommended to never store any personal information in `$_SESSION`. This would most critically include **credit card numbers**, **government issued ids**, and **passwords**; but would also extend into less assuming data like **names**, **emails**, **phone numbers**, etc which would allow a hacker to impersonate/compromise a legitimate user.  As a general rule, use worthless/non-personal values, such as numerical identifiers, in session data.

## Destroy an entire session
If you've got a session which you wish to destroy, you can do this with [`session_destroy()`](http://php.net/session_destroy)

    /*
        Let us assume that our session looks like this:
        Array([firstname] => Jon, [id] => 123)

        We first need to start our session:
    */
    session_start();
    
    /*
        We can now remove all the values from the `SESSION` superglobal:
        If you omitted this step all of the global variables stored in the 
        superglobal would still exist even though the session had been destroyed.
    */
    $_SESSION = array();

    // If it's desired to kill the session, also delete the session cookie.
    // Note: This will destroy the session, and not just the session data!
    if (ini_get("session.use_cookies")) {
        $params = session_get_cookie_params();
        setcookie(session_name(), '', time() - 42000,
            $params["path"], $params["domain"],
            $params["secure"], $params["httponly"]
        );
    }

    //Finally we can destroy the session:
    session_destroy();
    

Using `session_destroy()` is different to using something like `$_SESSION = array();` which will remove all of the values stored in the `SESSION` superglobal but it will not destroy the actual stored version of the session.


----------


**Note**: We use `$_SESSION = array();` instead of `session_unset()` because [the manual](http://php.net/session_destroy) stipulates: 

> Only use session_unset() for older deprecated code that does not use $_SESSION.

## Session name
# Checking if session cookies have been created
Session name is the name of the cookie used to store sessions. You can use this to detect if cookies for a session have been created for the user:

    if(isset($_COOKIE[session_name()])) {
        session_start();
    }

Note that this method is generally not useful unless you really don't want to create cookies unnecessarily.

# Changing session name
You can update the session name by calling `session_name()`.

    //Set the session name
    session_name('newname');
    //Start the session
    session_start();

If no argument is provided into `session_name()` then the current session name is returned.

> It should contain only alphanumeric characters; it should be short and descriptive (i.e. for users with enabled cookie warnings).
>The session name can't consist of digits only, at least one letter must be present. Otherwise a new session id is generated every time.

## Safe Session Start With no Errors
Many developers have this problem when they work on huge projects, especially if they work on some modular CMS on plugins, addons, components etc. Here is solution for safe session start where if first checked PHP version to cover all versions and on next is checked if session is started. If session not exists then I start session safe. If session exists nothing happen. 

    if (version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '7.0.0') >= 0) {
        if(session_status() == PHP_SESSION_NONE) {
            session_start(array(
              'cache_limiter' => 'private',
              'read_and_close' => true,
           ));
        }
    }
    else if (version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '5.4.0') >= 0)
    {
        if (session_status() == PHP_SESSION_NONE) {
            session_start();
        }
    }
    else
    {
        if(session_id() == '') {
            session_start();
        }
    }

This can help you a lot to avoid `session_start` error.
