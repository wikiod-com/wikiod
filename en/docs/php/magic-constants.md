Magic constants are distinguished by their `__CONSTANTNAME__` form. 

There are currently eight magical constants that change depending on where they are used. For example, the value of `__LINE__`depends on the line that it's used on in your script. 

These special constants are case-insensitive and are as follows: 

| Name| Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `__LINE__` | The current line number of the file.  |
| `__FILE__` | The full path and filename of the file with symlinks resolved. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned. |
| `__DIR__` | The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to `dirname(__FILE__)`. This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.  |
| `__FUNCTION__` | The current function name |
| `__CLASS__` | The class name. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. `Foo\Bar`). When used in a trait method, `__CLASS__` is the name of the class the trait is used in. |
| `__TRAIT__` | The trait name. The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. `Foo\Bar`). |
| `__METHOD__` | The class method name. |
| `__NAMESPACE__` | The name of the current namespace. |

Most common use case for these constants is debugging and logging

## Difference between __FUNCTION__ and __METHOD__
`__FUNCTION__` returns only the name of the function whereas `__METHOD__` returns the name of the class along with the name of the function:

    <?php

    class trick
    {
        public function doit()
        {
            echo __FUNCTION__;
        }

        public function doitagain()
        {
            echo __METHOD__;
        }
    }

    $obj = new trick();
    $obj->doit(); // Outputs: doit
    $obj->doitagain();  // Outputs: trick::doitagain

## Difference between __CLASS__, get_class() and get_called_class()
`__CLASS__` magic constant returns the same result as `get_class()` function called without parameters and they both return the name of the class where it was defined (i.e. where you wrote the function call/constant name ).

In contrast, `get_class($this)` and `get_called_class()` functions call, will both return the name of the actual class which was instantiated:

    <?php
    
    class Definition_Class {
    
      public function say(){
         echo '__CLASS__ value: ' . __CLASS__ . "\n";
         echo 'get_called_class() value: ' . get_called_class() . "\n";
         echo 'get_class($this) value: ' . get_class($this) . "\n";
         echo 'get_class() value: ' . get_class() . "\n";
      }
      
    }
    
    class Actual_Class extends Definition_Class {}
    
    $c = new Actual_Class();
    $c->say();
    // Output:
    // __CLASS__ value: Definition_Class
    // get_called_class() value: Actual_Class
    // get_class($this) value: Actual_Class
    // get_class() value: Definition_Class



## File & Directory Constants
Current file
=====
You can get the name of the current PHP file (with the absolute path) using the `__FILE__` magic constant. This is most often used as a logging/debugging technique.

```
echo "We are in the file:" , __FILE__ , "\n";
```

Current directory
=====

To get the absolute path to the directory where the current file is located use the `__DIR__` magic constant. 

```
echo "Our script is located in the:" , __DIR__ , "\n";
```


To get the absolute path to the directory where the current file is located, use `dirname(__FILE__)`.

    echo "Our script is located in the:" , dirname(__FILE__) , "\n";


Getting current directory is often used by PHP frameworks to set a base directory:

```
// index.php of the framework

define(BASEDIR, __DIR__); // using magic constant to define normal constant
```
------
```
// somefile.php looks for views:

$view = 'page';
$viewFile = BASEDIR . '/views/' . $view;
```

Separators
=====
> Windows system perfectly understands the `/` in paths so the
> `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` is used mainly when parsing paths.

Besides magic constants PHP also adds some fixed constants for working with paths:

 - `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` constant for separating directories in a path. Takes value  `/` on *nix, and `\` on Windows.
The example with views can be rewritten with:
```
$view = 'page';
$viewFile = BASEDIR . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR .'views' . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $view;
```
- Rarely used `PATH_SEPARATOR` constant for separating paths in the `$PATH` environment variable. It is `;` on Windows, `:` otherwise
