## Installing YAML extension
YAML does not come with a standard PHP installation, instead it needs to be installed as a PECL extension.  On linux/unix it can be installed with a simple

    pecl install yaml

Note that `libyaml-dev` package must be installed on the system, as the PECL package is simply a wrapper around libYAML calls.

Installation on Windows machines is different - you can either download a pre-compiled DLL or build from sources.

## Using YAML to store application configuration
[YAML](http://www.yaml.org) provides a way to store structured data.  The data can be a simple set of name-value pairs or a complex hierarchical data with values even being arrays.

Consider the following YAML file:

    database:
        driver: mysql
        host: database.mydomain.com
        port: 3306
        db_name: sample_db
        user: myuser
        password: Passw0rd
    debug: true
    country: us

Let's say, it's saved as `config.yaml`.  Then to read this file in PHP the following code can be used:

    $config = yaml_parse_file('config.yaml');
    print_r($config);

`print_r` will produce the following output:

    Array
    (
        [database] => Array
            (
                [driver] => mysql
                [host] => database.mydomain.com
                [port] => 3306
                [db_name] => sample_db
                [user] => myuser
                [password] => Passw0rd
            )
    
        [debug] => 1
        [country] => us
    )

Now config parameters can be used by simply using array elements:

    $dbConfig = $config['database'];
    
    $connectString = $dbConfig['driver']
        . ":host={$dbConfig['host']}"
        . ":port={$dbConfig['port']}"
        . ":dbname={$dbConfig['db_name']}"
        . ":user={$dbConfig['user']}"
        . ":password={$dbConfig['password']}";
    $dbConnection = new \PDO($connectString, $dbConfig['user'], $dbConfig['password']);
