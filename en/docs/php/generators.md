## The Yield Keyword
A `yield` statement is similar to a return statement, except that instead of stopping execution of the function and returning, yield instead returns a [Generator][2] object and pauses execution of the generator function.

Here is an example of the range function, written as a generator:

    function gen_one_to_three() {
        for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
            // Note that $i is preserved between yields.
            yield $i;
        }
    }

You can see that this function returns a [Generator][2] object by inspecting the output of `var_dump`:

    var_dump(gen_one_to_three())
    
    # Outputs:
    class Generator (0) {
    }
    


# Yielding Values

The [Generator][2] object can then be iterated over like an array.
    
    foreach (gen_one_to_three() as $value) {
        echo "$value\n";
    }

The above example will output:

    1
    2
    3

# Yielding Values with Keys

In addition to yielding values, you can also yield key/value pairs.

    function gen_one_to_three() {
        $keys = ["first", "second", "third"];

        for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
            // Note that $i is preserved between yields.
            yield $keys[$i - 1] => $i;
        }
    }
    
    foreach (gen_one_to_three() as $key => $value) {
        echo "$key: $value\n";
    }

The above example will output:

    first: 1
    second: 2
    third: 3

## Reading a large file with a generator
One common use case for generators is reading a file from disk and iterating over its contents. Below is a class that allows you to iterate over a CSV file. The memory usage for this script is very predictable, and will not fluctuate depending on the size of the CSV file.

    <?php
    
    class CsvReader
    {
        protected $file;
     
        public function __construct($filePath) {
            $this->file = fopen($filePath, 'r');
        }
     
        public function rows()
        {
            while (!feof($this->file)) {
                $row = fgetcsv($this->file, 4096);
                
                yield $row;
            }
            
            return;
        }
    }
     
    $csv = new CsvReader('/path/to/huge/csv/file.csv');
    
    foreach ($csv->rows() as $row) {
        // Do something with the CSV row.
    }

## Why use a generator?
Generators are useful when you need to generate a large collection to later iterate over. They're a simpler alternative to creating a class that implements an [Iterator][1], which is often overkill.

For example, consider the below function.

    function randomNumbers(int $length)
    {
        $array = [];
        
        for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
            $array[] = mt_rand(1, 10);
        }
        
        return $array;
    }

All this function does is generates an array that's filled with random numbers. To use it, we might do `randomNumbers(10)`, which will give us an array of 10 random numbers. What if we want to generate one million random numbers? `randomNumbers(1000000)` will do that for us, but at a cost of memory. One million integers stored in an array uses approximately **33 megabytes** of memory.

    $startMemory = memory_get_usage();
    
    $randomNumbers = randomNumbers(1000000);
    
    echo memory_get_usage() - $startMemory, ' bytes';

This is due to the entire one million random numbers being generated and returned at once, rather than one at a time. Generators are an easy way to solve this issue.

## Using the send()-function to pass values to a generator
Generators are fast coded and in many cases a slim alternative to heavy iterator-implementations. 
With the fast implementation comes a little lack of control when a generator should stop generating or if it should generate something else. However this can be achieved with the usage of the `send()` function, enabling the requesting function to send parameters to the generator after every loop.


    //Imagining accessing a large amount of data from a server, here is the generator for this:
    function generateDataFromServerDemo()
    {
        $indexCurrentRun = 0; //In this example in place of data from the server, I just send feedback everytime a loop ran through.
    
        $timeout = false;
        while (!$timeout)
        {
            $timeout = yield $indexCurrentRun; // Values are passed to caller. The next time the generator is called, it will start at this statement. If send() is used, $timeout will take this value.
            $indexCurrentRun++;
        }
    
        yield 'X of bytes are missing. </br>';
    }
    
    // Start using the generator
    $generatorDataFromServer = generateDataFromServerDemo ();
    foreach($generatorDataFromServer as $numberOfRuns)
    {
        if ($numberOfRuns < 10)
        {
            echo $numberOfRuns . "</br>";
        }
        else
        {
            $generatorDataFromServer->send(true); //sending data to the generator
            echo $generatorDataFromServer->current(); //accessing the latest element (hinting how many bytes are still missing.
        }
    }
    
Resulting in this Output:

## Re-writing randomNumbers() using a generator
Our `randomNumbers()` function can be re-written to use a generator.

    <?php
    
    function randomNumbers(int $length)
    {
        for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++) {
            // yield tells the PHP interpreter that this value
            // should be the one used in the current iteration.
            yield mt_rand(1, 10);
        }
    }
    
    foreach (randomNumbers(10) as $number) {
        echo "$number\n";
    }

Using a generator, we don't have to build an entire list of random numbers to return from the function, leading to much less memory being used.
