> With `pthreads` v3 `pthreads` can only be loaded when using the `cli` SAPI, thus it is a good practice to keep the `extension=pthreads.so` directive in `php-cli.ini` ONLY, if you are using PHP7 and Pthreads v3.

If you are using **Wamp** on **Windows**, you have to configure the extension in **php.ini** :

*Open php\php.ini and add:*

    extension=php_pthreads.dll

Concerning **Linux** users, you have to replace `.dll` by `.so`:

    extension=pthreads.so

You can directly execute this command to add it to `php.ini` (change `/etc/php.ini` with your custom path)

    echo "extension=pthreads.so" >> /etc/php.ini


## Getting Started
To start with multi-threading, you would need the `pthreads-ext` for php, which can be installed by

    $ pecl install pthreads

and adding the entry to `php.ini`.

A simple example:

    <?php
    // NOTE: Code uses PHP7 semantics.
    class MyThread extends Thread {
        /**
         * @var string
         * Variable to contain the message to be displayed.
         */
        private $message;
        
        public function __construct(string $message) {
            // Set the message value for this particular instance.
            $this->message = $message;
        }
    
        // The operations performed in this function is executed in the other thread.
        public function run() {
            echo $this->message;
        }
    }
    
    // Instantiate MyThread
    $myThread = new MyThread("Hello from an another thread!");
    // Start the thread. Also it is always a good practice to join the thread explicitly.
    // Thread::start() is used to initiate the thread,
    $myThread->start();
    // and Thread::join() causes the context to wait for the thread to finish executing
    $myThread->join();

## Using Pools and Workers
> Pooling provides a higher level abstraction of the Worker functionality, including the management of references in the way required by pthreads. From: http://php.net/manual/en/class.pool.php

Pools and workers provide an higher level of control and ease of creating multi-threaded
 
    <?php
    // This is the *Work* which would be ran by the worker.
    // The work which you'd want to do in your worker.
    // This class needs to extend the \Threaded or \Collectable or \Thread class.
    class AwesomeWork extends Thread {
        private $workName;
    
        /**
         * @param string $workName
         * The work name wich would be given to every work.
         */
        public function __construct(string $workName) {
            // The block of code in the constructor of your work,
            // would be executed when a work is submitted to your pool.
    
            $this->workName = $workName;
            printf("A new work was submitted with the name: %s\n", $workName);
        }
    
        public function run() {
            // This block of code in, the method, run
            // would be called by your worker.
            // All the code in this method will be executed in another thread.
            $workName = $this->workName;
            printf("Work named %s starting...\n", $workName);
            printf("New random number: %d\n", mt_rand());
        }
    }
    
    // Create an empty worker for the sake of simplicity.
    class AwesomeWorker extends Worker {
        public function run() {
            // You can put some code in here, which would be executed
            // before the Work's are started (the block of code in the `run` method of your Work)
            // by the Worker.
            /* ... */
        }
    }
    
    // Create a new Pool Instance.
    // The ctor of \Pool accepts two parameters.
    // First: The maximum number of workers your pool can create.
    // Second: The name of worker class.
    $pool = new \Pool(1, \AwesomeWorker::class);
    
    // You need to submit your jobs, rather the instance of
    // the objects (works) which extends the \Threaded class.
    $pool->submit(new \AwesomeWork("DeadlyWork"));
    $pool->submit(new \AwesomeWork("FatalWork"));
    
    // We need to explicitly shutdown the pool, otherwise,
    // unexpected things may happen.
    // See: http://stackoverflow.com/a/23600861/23602185
    $pool->shutdown();
