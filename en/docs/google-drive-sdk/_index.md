The [Google Drive API][1] and Google Drive SDK platform gives developers access to a group of APIs along with client libraries, language-specific examples, and documentation to help you develop apps that integrate with Drive.

The core functionality of Drive apps is to download and upload files in Google Drive. However, the Drive platform provides a lot more than just storage. This page describes some of that functionality and points you to resources for building it into your app.
