Excel VBA comes with a comprehensive *object model* which contains classes and objects that you can use to manipulate any part of the running Excel application. One of the most common objects you'll use is the **Application** object. This is a top-level catchall that represents the current running instance of Excel. Almost everything that is not connected to a particular Excel workbook is in the **Application** object.

The *Application* object, as a top-level object, has literally hundreds of properties, methods, and events which can be used to control every aspect of Excel.

## Simple Application Object example: Minimize the Excel window
This code uses the top level **Application** object to minimize the main Excel window.

    Sub MinimizeExcel()

        Application.WindowState = xlMinimized

    End Sub





## Simple Application Object example: Display Excel and VBE Version
    Sub DisplayExcelVersions()
    
        MsgBox "The version of Excel is " & Application.Version
        MsgBox "The version of the VBE is " & Application.VBE.Version
    
    End Sub

The use of the Application.Version property is useful for ensuring code only operates on a compatible version of Excel.
