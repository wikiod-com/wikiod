Using CustomDocumentProperties (CDPs) is a good method to store user defined values in a relatively safe way within the same work book, but avoiding to show related cell values simply in an unprotected work sheet *).  

Note: CDPs represent a separate collection comparable to BuiltInDocumentProperties, but allow to create user defined property names of your own instead of a fixed collection. 

*) Alternatively, you could enter values also in a hidden or "very hidden" workbook.



## Organizing new invoice numbers
Incrementing an invoice number and saving its value is a frequent task.
Using CustomDocumentProperties (CDPs) is a good method to store such numbers in a relatively safe way within the same work book, but avoiding to show related cell values simply in an unprotected work sheet.  

**Additional hint:** 

Alternatively, you could enter values also in a hidden worksheet or even a so called "very hidden" worksheet (see https://www.wikiod.com/excel-vba/excel-vba-tips-and-tricks#Using xlVeryHidden Sheets). Of course, it's possible to save data also to external files (e.g. ini file, csv or any other type) or the registry.

**Example content**:

The example below shows 
- a function NextInvoiceNo that sets and returns the next invoice number, 
- a procedure DeleteInvoiceNo, that deletes the invoice CDP completely, as well as 
- a procedure showAllCDPs listing the complete CDPs collection with all names. Not using VBA, you can also list them via the workbook's information: Info | Properties [DropDown:] | Advanced Properties | Custom

You can get and set the next invoice number (last no plus one) simply by calling the above mentioned function, returning a string value in order to facilitate adding prefixes. "InvoiceNo" is implicitly used as CDP name in all procedures.

    Dim sNumber As String
    sNumber = NextInvoiceNo ()

**Example code:**
    

    Option Explicit

    Sub Test()
      Dim sNumber As String
      sNumber = NextInvoiceNo()
      MsgBox "New Invoice No: " & sNumber, vbInformation, "New Invoice Number"
    End Sub

    Function NextInvoiceNo() As String
    ' Purpose: a) Set Custom Document Property (CDP) "InvoiceNo" if not yet existing
    '          b) Increment CDP value and return new value as string
    ' Declarations
      Dim prop As Object
      Dim ret  As String
      Dim wb   As Workbook
    ' Set workbook and CDPs
      Set wb = ThisWorkbook
      Set prop = wb.CustomDocumentProperties
  
      ' -------------------------------------------------------
      ' Generate new CDP "InvoiceNo" if not yet existing
      ' -------------------------------------------------------
        If Not CDPExists("InvoiceNo") Then
        '  set temporary starting value "0"
           prop.Add "InvoiceNo", False, msoPropertyTypeString, "0"
        End If
  
      ' --------------------------------------------------------
      ' Increment invoice no and return function value as string
      ' --------------------------------------------------------
           ret = Format(Val(prop("InvoiceNo")) + 1, "0")
      ' a) Set CDP "InvoiceNo" = ret
           prop("InvoiceNo").value = ret
      ' b) Return function value 
           NextInvoiceNo = ret
    End Function
