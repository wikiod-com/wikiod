Excel-VBA Optimization refers also to coding better error handling by documentation and additional details. This is shown here.

*) Line numbers represent are integers, that is a signed 16 bit data type in the range of -32,768 to 32,767, otherwise you produce an overflow. Usually line numbers are inserted in steps of 10 over a part of the code or all procedures of a module as a whole.




## Disabling Worksheet Updating
Disabling calculation of the worksheet can decrease running time of the macro significantly. Moreover, disabling events, screen updating and page breaks would be beneficial. Following `Sub` can be used in any macro for this purpose.

    Sub OptimizeVBA(isOn As Boolean)
        Application.Calculation = IIf(isOn, xlCalculationManual, xlCalculationAutomatic)
        Application.EnableEvents = Not(isOn)
        Application.ScreenUpdating = Not(isOn)
        ActiveSheet.DisplayPageBreaks = Not(isOn)
    End Sub

For optimization follow the below pseudo-code:

    Sub MyCode()
        
        OptimizeVBA True
  
        'Your code goes here

        OptimizeVBA False
   
    End Sub

## Optimizing Error Search by Extended Debugging
**Using Line Numbers ... and documenting them in case of error**
("The importance of seeing Erl")

Detecting which line raises an error is a substantial part of any debugging and narrows the search for the cause. To document identified error lines with a short description completes a successful error tracking, at best together with the names of module and procedure. The example below saves these data to a log file.

**Back ground**

The error object returns error number (Err.Number) and error description (Err.Description), but doesn't explicitly respond to the question where to locate the error. The **Erl** function, however, does, but on condition that you add **line numbers *)** to the code (BTW one of several other concessions to former Basic times). 

If there are no error lines at all, then the Erl function returns 0, if numbering is incomplete you'll get the procedure's last preceding line number. 


    Option Explicit


    Public Sub MyProc1()
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim j As Integer
    On Error GoTo LogErr
    10     j = 1 / 0    ' raises an error
    okay:
    Debug.Print "i=" & i
    Exit Sub

    LogErr:
    MsgBox LogErrors("MyModule", "MyProc1", Err), vbExclamation, "Error " & Err.Number
    Stop
    Resume Next
    End Sub

    Public Function LogErrors( _
               ByVal sModule As String, _
               ByVal sProc As String, _
               Err As ErrObject) As String
    ' Purpose: write error number, description and Erl to log file and return error text
      Dim sLogFile As String: sLogFile = ThisWorkbook.Path & Application.PathSeparator & "LogErrors.txt"
      Dim sLogTxt  As String
      Dim lFile    As Long
    
    ' Create error text
      sLogTxt = sModule & "|" & sProc & "|Erl " & Erl & "|Err " & Err.Number & "|" & Err.Description
    
      On Error Resume Next
      lFile = FreeFile
    
      Open sLogFile For Append As lFile
      Print #lFile, Format$(Now(), "yy.mm.dd hh:mm:ss "); sLogTxt
          Print #lFile,
      Close lFile
    ' Return error text
      LogErrors = sLogTxt
     End Function


'**Additional Code to show log file**

    Sub ShowLogFile()
    Dim sLogFile As String: sLogFile = ThisWorkbook.Path & Application.PathSeparator & "LogErrors.txt"

    On Error GoTo LogErr
    Shell "notepad.exe " & sLogFile, vbNormalFocus
 
    okay:
    On Error Resume Next
    Exit Sub
 
    LogErr:
    MsgBox LogErrors("MyModule", "ShowLogFile", Err), vbExclamation, "Error No " & Err.Number
    Resume okay
    End Sub



## Checking time of execution
Different procedures can give out the same result, but they would use different processing time. In order to check out which one is faster, a code like this can be used:

    time1 = Timer

    For Each iCell In MyRange
       iCell = "text"
    Next iCell

    time2 = Timer

    For i = 1 To 30
       MyRange.Cells(i) = "text"
    Next i

    time3 = Timer

    debug.print "Proc1 time: " & cStr(time2-time1)
    debug.print "Proc2 time: " & cStr(time3-time2)

----

[MicroTimer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff700515(v=office.14).aspx#Anchor_5):

    Private Declare PtrSafe Function getFrequency Lib "Kernel32" Alias "QueryPerformanceFrequency" (cyFrequency As Currency) As Long
    Private Declare PtrSafe Function getTickCount Lib "Kernel32" Alias "QueryPerformanceCounter" (cyTickCount As Currency) As Long

    Function MicroTimer() As Double
        Dim cyTicks1 As Currency
        Static cyFrequency As Currency
    
        MicroTimer = 0
        If cyFrequency = 0 Then getFrequency cyFrequency        'Get frequency
        getTickCount cyTicks1                                   'Get ticks
        If cyFrequency Then MicroTimer = cyTicks1 / cyFrequency 'Returns Seconds
    End Function

## Using With blocks
Using with blocks can accelerate the process of running a macro. Instead writing a range, chart name, worksheet, etc. you can use with-blocks like below;

    With ActiveChart
        .Parent.Width = 400
        .Parent.Height = 145
        .Parent.Top = 77.5 + 165 * step - replacer * 15
        .Parent.Left = 5
    End With 
    
Which is faster than this:
            
    ActiveChart.Parent.Width = 400
    ActiveChart.Parent.Height = 145
    ActiveChart.Parent.Top = 77.5 + 165 * step - replacer * 15
    ActiveChart.Parent.Left = 5

---

Notes:

- Once a With block is entered, object can't be changed. As a result, you can't use a single With statement to affect a number of different objects

- **Don't jump into or out of With blocks**. If statements in a With block are executed, but either the With or End With statement is not executed, **a temporary variable containing a reference to the object remains in memory until you exit the procedure**

- Don't Loop inside With statements, especially if the cached object is used as an iterator

- You can nest With statements by placing one With block within another. However, because members of outer With blocks are masked within the inner With blocks, you must provide a fully qualified object reference in an inner With block to any member of an object in an outer With block.

Nesting Example:

This example uses the With statement to execute a series of statements on a single object.  
The object and its properties are generic names used for illustration purposes only.

    With MyObject 
        .Height = 100               'Same as MyObject.Height = 100. 
        .Caption = "Hello World"    'Same as MyObject.Caption = "Hello World". 
        With .Font 
            .Color = Red            'Same as MyObject.Font.Color = Red. 
            .Bold = True            'Same as MyObject.Font.Bold = True. 
            MyObject.Height = 200   'Inner-most With refers to MyObject.Font (must be qualified
        End With
    End With

## Row Deletion - Performance
- Deleting rows is slow, specially when looping through cells and deleting rows, one by one

- A different approach is using an AutoFilter to hide the rows to be deleted
- Copy the visible range and Paste it into a new WorkSheet
- Remove the initial sheet entirely
- With this method, the more rows to delete, the faster it will be

Example:

    Option Explicit

    'Deleted rows: 775,153, Total Rows: 1,000,009, Duration: 1.87 sec

    Public Sub DeleteRows()
        Dim oldWs As Worksheet, newWs As Worksheet, wsName As String, ur As Range
    
        Set oldWs = ThisWorkbook.ActiveSheet
        wsName = oldWs.Name
        Set ur = oldWs.Range("F2", oldWs.Cells(oldWs.Rows.Count, "F").End(xlUp))

        Application.ScreenUpdating = False
        Set newWs = Sheets.Add(After:=oldWs)    'Create a new WorkSheet

        With ur    'Copy visible range after Autofilter (modify Criteria1 and 2 accordingly)
            .AutoFilter Field:=1, Criteria1:="<>0", Operator:=xlAnd, Criteria2:="<>"
            oldWs.UsedRange.Copy
        End With
        'Paste all visible data into the new WorkSheet (values and formats)
        With newWs.Range(oldWs.UsedRange.Cells(1).Address)
            .PasteSpecial xlPasteColumnWidths
            .PasteSpecial xlPasteAll
            newWs.Cells(1, 1).Select: newWs.Cells(1, 1).Copy
        End With

        With Application
            .CutCopyMode = False
            .DisplayAlerts = False
                oldWs.Delete
            .DisplayAlerts = True
            .ScreenUpdating = True
        End With
        newWs.Name = wsName
    End Sub

## Disabling All Excel Functionality Before executing large macros
The procedures bellow will temporarily disable all Excel features at WorkBook and WorkSheet level

- FastWB() is a toggle that accepts On or Off flags
- FastWS() accepts an Optional WorkSheet object, or none
- If the ws parameter is missing it will turn all features on and off for all WorkSheets in the collection

   - A custom type can be used to capture all settings before turning them off
   - At the end of the process, the initial settings can be restored

---

    Public Sub FastWB(Optional ByVal opt As Boolean = True)
        With Application
            .Calculation = IIf(opt, xlCalculationManual, xlCalculationAutomatic)
            If .DisplayAlerts <> Not opt Then .DisplayAlerts = Not opt
            If .DisplayStatusBar <> Not opt Then .DisplayStatusBar = Not opt
            If .EnableAnimations <> Not opt Then .EnableAnimations = Not opt
            If .EnableEvents <> Not opt Then .EnableEvents = Not opt
            If .ScreenUpdating <> Not opt Then .ScreenUpdating = Not opt
        End With
        FastWS , opt
    End Sub

---

    Public Sub FastWS(Optional ByVal ws As Worksheet, Optional ByVal opt As Boolean = True)
        If ws Is Nothing Then
            For Each ws In Application.ThisWorkbook.Sheets
                OptimiseWS ws, opt
            Next
        Else
            OptimiseWS ws, opt
        End If
    End Sub
    Private Sub OptimiseWS(ByVal ws As Worksheet, ByVal opt As Boolean)
        With ws
            .DisplayPageBreaks = False
            .EnableCalculation = Not opt
            .EnableFormatConditionsCalculation = Not opt
            .EnablePivotTable = Not opt
        End With
    End Sub

---

Restore all Excel settings to default

    Public Sub XlResetSettings()    'default Excel settings
        With Application
            .Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic
            .DisplayAlerts = True
            .DisplayStatusBar = True
            .EnableAnimations = False
            .EnableEvents = True
            .ScreenUpdating = True
            Dim sh As Worksheet
            For Each sh In Application.ThisWorkbook.Sheets
                With sh
                    .DisplayPageBreaks = False
                    .EnableCalculation = True
                    .EnableFormatConditionsCalculation = True
                    .EnablePivotTable = True
                End With
            Next
        End With
    End Sub
