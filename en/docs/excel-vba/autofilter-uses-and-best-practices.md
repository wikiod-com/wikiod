***Autofilter*** ultimate goal is to provide in the quickest way possible data mining from hundreds or thousands of rows data in order to get the attention in the items we want to focus on. It can receive parameters such as "text/values/colors" and they can be stacked among columns. You may connect up to 2 criteria per column based in logical connectors and sets of rules. Remark: Autofilter works by filtering rows, there is no Autofilter to filter columns (at least not natively).

'To use Autofilter within VBA we need to call with at least the following parameters: 

Sheet("MySheet").Range("MyRange").Autofilter Field=(ColumnNumberWithin"MyRange"ToBeFilteredInNumericValue) Criteria1:= "WhatIWantToFilter" 

'There are plenty of examples either on the web or here [at stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28575754/filter-out-multiple-criteria-using-excel-vba)

## Smartfilter!
***Problem situation***
<br>Warehouse administrator has a sheet ("Record") where every logistics movement performed by the facility is stored, he may filter as needed, although, this is very time consuming and he would like to improve the process in order to calculate inquiries faster, for example: How many "pulp" do we have now (in all racks)? How many pulp do we have now (in rack #5)? Filters are a great tool but, they are somewhat limited to answer these kind of question in matter of seconds.

***Macro solution:***
<br>The coder knows that ***autofilters are the best, fast and most reliable solution*** in these kind of scenarios since ***the data exists already in the worksheet*** and the ***input for them can be obtained easily*** -in this case, by user input-.
<br>The approach used is to create a sheet called "SmartFilter" where administrator can 
easily filter multiple data as needed and calculation will be performed instantly as well.
<br>He uses 2 modules and the `Worksheet_Change` event for this matter

<br>Code For SmartFilter Worksheet:

    Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim ItemInRange As Range
    Const CellsFilters As String = "C2,E2,G2"
        Call ExcelBusy
        For Each ItemInRange In Target
        If Not Intersect(ItemInRange, Range(CellsFilters)) Is Nothing Then Call Inventory_Filter
        Next ItemInRange
        Call ExcelNormal
    End Sub
Code for module 1, called "General_Functions"

    Sub ExcelNormal()
            With Excel.Application
            .EnableEvents = True
            .Cursor = xlDefault
            .ScreenUpdating = True
            .DisplayAlerts = True
            .StatusBar = False
            .CopyObjectsWithCells = True
            End With
    End Sub
    Sub ExcelBusy()
            With Excel.Application
            .EnableEvents = False
            .Cursor = xlWait
            .ScreenUpdating = False
            .DisplayAlerts = False
            .StatusBar = False
            .CopyObjectsWithCells = True
            End With
    End Sub
    Sub Select_Sheet(NameSheet As String, Optional VerifyExistanceOnly As Boolean)
        On Error GoTo Err01Select_Sheet
        Sheets(NameSheet).Visible = True
        If VerifyExistanceOnly = False Then ' 1. If VerifyExistanceOnly = False

        End If ' 1. If VerifyExistanceOnly = False
        If 1 = 2 Then '99. If error
    Err01Select_Sheet:
        MsgBox "Err01Select_Sheet: Sheet " & NameSheet & " doesn't exist!", vbCritical: Call ExcelNormal: On Error GoTo -1: End

    End Sub
    Function General_Functions_Find_Title(InSheet As String, TitleToFind As String, Optional InRange As Range, Optional IsNeededToExist As Boolean, Optional IsWhole As Boolean) As Range
    Dim DummyRange As Range
        On Error GoTo Err01General_Functions_Find_Title
        If InRange Is Nothing Then ' 1. If InRange Is Nothing
        Set DummyRange = IIf(IsWhole = True, Sheets(InSheet).Cells.Find(TitleToFind, LookAt:=xlWhole), Sheets(InSheet).Cells.Find(TitleToFind, LookAt:=xlPart))
        Else ' 1. If InRange Is Nothing
        Set DummyRange = IIf(IsWhole = True, Sheets(InSheet).Range(InRange.Address).Find(TitleToFind, LookAt:=xlWhole), Sheets(InSheet).Range(InRange.Address).Find(TitleToFind, LookAt:=xlPart))
        End If ' 1. If InRange Is Nothing
        Set General_Functions_Find_Title = DummyRange
        If 1 = 2 Or DummyRange Is Nothing Then '99. If error

<br>***Testing and results:***

[![Smartfilter Testing][2]][2]
<br>As we saw in the previous image, this task has been achieved easily. By using ***autofilters*** a solution was provided that just ***takes seconds to compute, is easy to explain to the user*** -since s/he is familiar with this command- and ***took a few lines to the coder.***
