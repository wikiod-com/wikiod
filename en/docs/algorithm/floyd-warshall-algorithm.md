## All Pair Shortest Path Algorithm
[Floyd-Warshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm)'s algorithm is for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights. A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pair of vertices. With a little variation, it can print the shortest path and can detect negative cycles in a graph. Floyd-Warshall is a Dynamic-Programming algorithm.

Let's look at an example. We're going to apply Floyd-Warshall's algorithm on this graph:[![Example Graph][1]][1]

First thing we do is, we take two 2D matrices. These are [adjacency matrices](https://www.wikiod.com/algorithm/graph#Storing Graphs (Adjacency Matrix)). The size of the matrices is going to be the total number of vertices. For our graph, we will take **4 * 4** matrices. The **Distance Matrix** is going to store the minimum distance found so far between two vertices. At first, for the edges, if there is an edge between **u-v** and the distance/weight is **w**, we'll store: `distance[u][v] = w`. For all the edges that doesn't exist, we're gonna put *infinity*. The **Path Matrix** is for regenerating minimum distance path between two vertices. So initially, if there is a path between **u** and **v**, we're going to put `path[u][v] = u`. This means the best way to come to **vertex-v** from **vertex-u** is to use the edge that connects **v** with **u**. If there is no path between two vertices, we're going to put **N** there indicating there is no path available now. The two tables for our graph will look like:

    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |            |     |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  1  |  0  |  3  |  6  |  15 |            |  1  |  N  |  1  |  1  |  1  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  2  | inf |  0  | -2  | inf |            |  2  |  N  |  N  |  2  |  N  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  3  | inf | inf |  0  |  2  |            |  3  |  N  |  N  |  N  |  3  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  4  |  1  | inf | inf |  0  |            |  4  |  4  |  N  |  N  |  N  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                distance                                     path
Since there is no loop, the diagonals are set **N**. And the distance from the vertex itself is **0**.

To apply Floyd-Warshall algorithm, we're going to select a middle vertex **k**. Then for each vertex **i**, we're going to check if we can go from **i** to **k** and then **k** to **j**, where **j** is another vertex and minimize the cost of going from **i** to **j**. If the current **distance[i][j]** is greater than **distance[i][k]** + **distance[k][j]**, we're going to put **distance[i][j]** equals to the summation of those two distances. And the **path[i][j]** will be set to **path[k][j]**, as it is better to go from **i** to **k**, and then **k** to **j**. All the vertices will be selected as **k**. We'll have 3 nested loops: for **k** going from 1 to 4, **i** going from 1 to 4 and **j** going from 1 to 4. We're going check:

    if distance[i][j] > distance[i][k] + distance[k][j]
        distance[i][j] := distance[i][k] + distance[k][j]
        path[i][j] := path[k][j]
    end if
So what we're basically checking is, *for every pair of vertices, do we get a shorter distance by going through another vertex?* The total number of operations for our graph will be **4 * 4 * 4** = **64**. That means we're going to do this check **64** times. Let's look at a few of them:

When **k** = **1**, **i** = **2** and **j** = **3**, **distance[i][j]** is **-2**, which is not greater than **distance[i][k]** + **distance[k][j]** = **-2** + **0** = **-2**. So it will remain unchanged. Again, when **k** = **1**, **i** = **4** and **j** = **2**, **distance[i][j]** = **infinity**, which is greater than **distance[i][k]** + **distance[k][j]** = **1** + **3** = **4**. So we put **distance[i][j]** = **4**, and we put **path[i][j]** = **path[k][j]** = **1**. What this means is, to go from **vertex-4** to **vertex-2**, the path **4->1->2** is shorter than the existing path. This is how we populate both matrices. The calculation for each step is shown [here](http://imgur.com/a/NU6Hg). After making necessary changes, our matrices will look like:

    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |            |     |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  1  |  0  |  3  |  1  |  3  |            |  1  |  N  |  1  |  2  |  3  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  2  |  1  |  0  | -2  |  0  |            |  2  |  4  |  N  |  2  |  3  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  3  |  3  |  6  |  0  |  2  |            |  3  |  4  |  1  |  N  |  3  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |  4  |  1  |  4  |  2  |  0  |            |  4  |  4  |  1  |  2  |  N  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+            +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
                distance                                     path
This is our shortest distance matrix. For example, the shortest distance from **1** to **4** is **3** and the shortest distance between **4** to **3** is **2**. Our pseudo-code will be:

    Procedure Floyd-Warshall(Graph):
    for k from 1 to V     // V denotes the number of vertex
        for i from 1 to V
           for j from 1 to V
               if distance[i][j] > distance[i][k] + distance[k][j]
                   distance[i][j] := distance[i][k] + distance[k][j]
                   path[i][j] := path[k][j]
               end if
           end for
        end for
    end for
**Printing the path:**

To print the path, we'll check the **Path** matrix. To print the path from **u** to **v**, we'll start from **path[u][v]**. We'll set keep changing **v** = **path[u][v]** until we find **path[u][v]** = **u** and push every values of **path[u][v]** in a stack. After finding **u**, we'll print **u** and start popping items from the stack and print them. This works because the **path** matrix stores the value of the vertex which shares the shortest path to **v** from any other node. The pseudo-code will be:

    Procedure PrintPath(source, destination):
    s = Stack()
    S.push(destination)
    while Path[source][destination] is not equal to source
        S.push(Path[source][destination])
        destination := Path[source][destination]
    end while
    print -> source
    while S is not empty
        print -> S.pop
    end while
**Finding Negative Edge Cycle:**

To find out if there is a negative edge cycle, we'll need to check the main diagonal of **distance** matrix. If any value on the diagonal is negative, that means there is a negative cycle in the graph.

**Complexity:**

The complexity of Floyd-Warshall algorithm is **O(V³)** and the space complexity is: **O(V²)**.
