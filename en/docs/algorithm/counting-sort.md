## Counting Sort Basic Information
[Counting sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_sort) is an integer sorting algorithm for a collection of objects that sorts according to the keys of the objects.

**Steps**

1. Construct a working array *C* that has size equal to the range of the input array *A*.
2. Iterate through *A*, assigning *C*[x] based on the number of times x appeared in *A*.
3. Transform *C* into an array where *C*[x] refers to the number of values â‰¤ x by iterating through the array, assigning to each *C*[x] the sum of its prior value and all values in *C* that come before it.
4. Iterate backwards through *A*, placing each value in to a new sorted array *B* at the index recorded in *C*. This is done for a given *A*[x] by assigning *B*[*C*[*A*[x]]] to *A*[x], and decrementing *C*[*A*[x]] in case there were duplicate values in the original unsorted array.

**Auxiliary Space:** `O(n+k)` <br>
**Time Complexity:** Worst-case: `O(n+k)`, Best-case: `O(n)`, Average-case `O(n+k)`

## Psuedocode Implementation

Constraints:

 1. Input (an array to be sorted)
 2. Number of element in input (n)
 3. Keys in the range of *0..k-1* (k)
 4. Count (an array of number)

Pseudocode:

    for x in input:
        count[key(x)] += 1
    total = 0
    for i in range(k):
        oldCount = count[i]
        count[i] = total
        total += oldCount
    for x in input:
        output[count[key(x)]] = x
        count[key(x)] += 1
    return output


## C# Implementation
    public class CountingSort
    {
        public static void SortCounting(int[] input, int min, int max)
        {
            var count = new int[max - min + 1];
            var z = 0;

            for (var i = 0; i < count.Length; i++)
                count[i] = 0;

            foreach (int i in input)
                count[i - min]++;

            for (var i = min; i <= max; i++)
            {
                while (count[i - min]-- > 0)
                {
                    input[z] = i;
                    ++z;
                }
            }
        }

        public static int[] Main(int[] input)
        {
            SortCounting(input, input.Min(), input.Max());
            return input;
        }
    }
