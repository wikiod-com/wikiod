## Matrix Exponentiation to Solve Example Problems
*Find f(n): n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number.* The problem is quite easy when **n** is relatively small. We can use simple recursion, `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)`, or we can use dynamic programming approach to avoid the calculation of same function over and over again. But what will you do if the problem says, **Given 0 < n < 10⁹, find f(n) mod 999983?** Dynamic programming will fail, so how do we tackle this problem?

First let's see how matrix exponentiation can help to represent recursive relation.

**Prerequisites:**

 - Given two matrices, know how to find their product. Further, given the product matrix of two matrices, and one of them, know how to find the other matrix.
 - Given a matrix of size **d X d**, know how to find its n<sup>th</sup> power in **O(d<sup>3</sup>log(n))**.

**Patterns:**

At first we need a recursive relation and we want to find a matrix **M** which can lead us to the desired state from a set of already known states. Let's assume that, we know the **k** states of a given recurrence relation and we want to find the **(k+1)<sup>th</sup>** state. Let **M** be a **k X k** matrix, and we build a matrix **A:[k X 1]** from the known states of the recurrence relation, now we want to get a matrix **B:[k X 1]** which will represent the set of next states, i. e. **M X A = B** as shown below:

           |  f(n)  |     | f(n+1) |
           | f(n-1) |     |  f(n)  |
       M X | f(n-2) |  =  | f(n-1) |
           | ...... |     | ...... |
           | f(n-k) |     |f(n-k+1)|
So, if we can design **M** accordingly, our job will be done! The matrix will then be used to represent the recurrence relation.

**Type 1:** <br>
Let's start with the simplest one, `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)` <br>
We get, `f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1)`. <br>
Let's assume, we know `f(n)` and `f(n-1)`; We want to find out `f(n+1)`. <br>
From the situation stated above, matrix **A** and matrix **B** can be formed as shown below:

     Matrix A          Matrix B

    |  f(n)  |        | f(n+1) |
    | f(n-1) |        |  f(n)  |
[Note: Matrix **A** will be always designed in such a way that, every state on which `f(n+1)` depends, will be present] <br>
Now, we need to design a **2X2** matrix **M** such that, it satisfies **M X A = B** as stated above. <br>
The first element of **B** is `f(n+1)` which is actually `f(n) + f(n-1)`. To get this, from matrix **A**, we need, **1 X f(n)** and **1 X f(n-1)**. So the first row of **M** will be **[1 1]**.

    | 1   1 |  X  |  f(n)  |  =  | f(n+1) |
    | ----- |     | f(n-1) |     | ------ |
[Note: ----- means we are not concerned about this value.] <br>
Similarly, 2nd item of **B** is `f(n)` which can be got by simply taking **1 X f(n)** from **A**, so the 2nd row of **M** is [1 0].

    | ----- |  X  |  f(n)  |  =  | ------ |
    | 1   0 |     | f(n-1) |     |  f(n)  |
Then we get our desired **2 X 2** matrix **M**.

    | 1   1 |  X  |  f(n)  |  =  | f(n+1) |
    | 1   0 |     | f(n-1) |     |  f(n)  |
These matrices are simply derived using matrix multiplication.

**Type 2:**

Let's make it a little complex: find `f(n) = a X f(n-1) + b X f(n-2)`, where **a** and **b** are constants.<br>
This tells us, `f(n+1) = a X f(n) + b X f(n-1)`. <br>
By this far, this should be clear that the dimension of the matrices will be equal to the number of dependencies, i.e. in this particular example, again 2. So for **A** and **B**, we can build two matrices of size **2 X 1**:

    Matrix A             Matrix B
    |  f(n)  |          | f(n+1) |
    | f(n-1) |          |  f(n)  |
Now for `f(n+1) = a X f(n) + b X f(n-1)`, we need [a, b] in the first row of objective matrix **M**. And for the 2nd item in **B**, i.e. `f(n)` we already have that in matrix **A**, so we just take that, which leads, the 2nd row of the matrix M to [1 0]. This time we get:

    | a   b |  X  |  f(n)  |  =  | f(n+1) |
    | 1   0 |     | f(n-1) |     |  f(n)  |
Pretty simple, eh?

**Type 3:**

If you've survived through to this stage, you've grown much older, now let's face a bit complex relation: find `f(n) = a X f(n-1) + c X f(n-3)`?<br>
Ooops! A few minutes ago, all we saw were contiguous states, but here, the state **f(n-2)** is missing. Now?

Actually this is not a problem anymore, we can convert the relation as follows: `f(n) = a X f(n-1) + 0 X f(n-2) + c X f(n-3)`, deducing `f(n+1) = a X f(n) + 0 X f(n-1) + c X f(n-2)`. Now, we see that, this is actually a form described in Type 2. So here the objective matrix **M** will be **3 X 3**, and the elements are:

    | a 0 c |     |  f(n)  |     | f(n+1) |
    | 1 0 0 |  X  | f(n-1) |  =  |  f(n)  |
    | 0 1 0 |     | f(n-2) |     | f(n-1) |
These are calculated in the same way as type 2, if you find it difficult, try it on pen and paper.

**Type 4:**

Life is getting complex as hell, and Mr, Problem now asks you to find `f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + c` where **c** is any constant. <br>
Now this is a new one and all we have seen in past, after the multiplication, each state in **A** transforms to its next state in **B**.

    f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + c
    f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) + c
    f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n) + c
    .................... so on
So , normally we can't get it through previous fashion, but how about we add **c** as a state:

          |  f(n)  |   | f(n+1) |
      M X | f(n-1) | = |  f(n)  |
          |    c   |   |    c   |
Now, its not much hard to design **M**. Here's how its done, but don't forget to verify:

      | 1 1 1 |     |  f(n)  |     | f(n+1) |
      | 1 0 0 |  X  | f(n-1) |  =  |  f(n)  |
      | 0 0 1 |     |    c   |     |    c   |
**Type 5:**

Let's put it altogether: find `f(n) = a X f(n-1) + c X f(n-3) + d X f(n-4) + e`.
Let's leave it as an exercise for you. First try to find out the states and matrix **M**. And check if it matches with your solution. Also find matrix **A** and **B**.

    | a 0 c d 1 |
    | 1 0 0 0 0 |
    | 0 1 0 0 0 |
    | 0 0 1 0 0 |
    | 0 0 0 0 1 |

**Type 6:**

Sometimes the recurrence is given like this:

    f(n) = f(n-1)   -> if n is odd
    f(n) = f(n-2)   -> if n is even
In short:

    f(n) = (n&1) X f(n-1) + (!(n&1)) X f(n-2)
Here, we can split the functions in the basis of odd even and keep 2 different matrix for both of them and calculate them separately.

**Type 7:**

Feeling little too confident? Good for you. Sometimes we may need to maintain more than one recurrence, where they are interested. For example, let a recurrence re;atopm be:

    g(n) = 2g(n-1) + 2g(n-2) + f(n)
Here, recurrence *g(n)* is dependent upon `f(n)` and this can be calculated in the same matrix but of increased dimensions. From these let's at first design the matrices **A** and **B**.

     Matrix A            Matrix B
    |  g(n)  |          | g(n+1) |
    | g(n-1) |          |  g(n)  |
    | f(n+1) |          | f(n+2) |
    |  f(n)  |          | f(n+1) |
Here, `g(n+1) = 2g(n-1) + f(n+1) and f(n+2) = 2f(n+1) + 2f(n)`.
Now, using the processes stated above, we can find the objective matrix **M** to be:

    | 2 2 1 0 |
    | 1 0 0 0 |
    | 0 0 2 2 |
    | 0 0 1 0 |

So, these are the basic categories of recurrence relations which are used to solveby this simple technique.
