## Introduction To Depth-First Search
[Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. A version of depth-first search was investigated in the 19th century French mathematician Charles Pierre Tr√©maux as a strategy for solving mazes.

Depth-first search is a systematic way to find all the vertices reachable from a source vertex. Like breadth-first search, DFS traverse a connected component of a given graph and defines a spanning tree. The basic idea of depth-first search is methodically exploring every edge. We start over from a different vertices as necessary. As soon as we discover a vertex, DFS starts exploring from it (unlike BFS, which puts a vertex on a queue so that it explores from it later).

Let's look at an example. We'll traverse this graph:

We'll traverse the graph following these rules:

 - We'll start from the source.
 - No node will be visited twice.
 - The nodes we didn't visit yet, will be colored white.
 - The node we visited, but didn't visit all of its child nodes, will be colored grey.
 - Completely traversed nodes will be colored black.

Let's look at it step by step:[![Step 1 and 2][2]][2][![Step 3 and 4][3]][3][![Step 5 and 6][4]][4][![Step 7 and 8][5]][5][![Step 9 and 10][6]][6][![Step 11][7]][7]

We can see one important keyword. That is **backedge**. You can see. **5-1** is called backedge. This is because, we're not yet done with **node-1**, so going from another node to **node-1** means there's a cycle in the graph. In DFS, if we can go from one gray node to another, we can be certain that the graph has a cycle. This is one of the ways of detecting cycle in a graph. Depending on **source** node and the order of the nodes we visit, we can find out any edge in a cycle as **backedge**. For example: if we went to **5** from **1** first, we'd have found out **2-1** as backedge.

The edge that we take to go from gray node to white node are called **tree edge**. If we only keep the **tree edge**'s and remove others, we'll get **DFS tree**.

In undirected graph, if we can visit a already visited node, that must be a **backedge**. But for directed graphs, we must check the colors. *If and only if we can go from one gray node to another gray node, that is called a backedge*.

In DFS, we can also keep timestamps for each node, which can be used in many ways (e.g.: Topological Sort).

 1. When a node **v** is changed from white to gray the time is recorded in **d[v]**.
 2. When a node **v** is changed from gray to black the time is recorded in **f[v]**.

Here **d\[]** means *discovery time* and **f\[]** means *finishing time*. Our pesudo-code will look like:

    Procedure DFS(G):
    for each node u in V[G]
        color[u] := white
        parent[u] := NULL
    end for
    time := 0
    for each node u in V[G]
        if color[u] == white
            DFS-Visit(u)
        end if
    end for

    Procedure DFS-Visit(u):
    color[u] := gray
    time := time + 1
    d[u] := time
    for each node v adjacent to u
        if color[v] == white
            parent[v] := u
            DFS-Visit(v)
        end if
    end for
    color[u] := black
    time := time + 1
    f[u] := time
    
**Complexity:**

Each nodes and edges are visited once. So the complexity of DFS is **O(V+E)**, where **V** denotes the number of nodes and **E** denotes the number of edges.

**Applications of Depth First Search:**

 - Finding all pair shortest path in an undirected graph.
 - Detecting cycle in a graph.
 - Path finding.
 - Topological Sort.
 - Testing if a graph is bipartite.
 - Finding Strongly Connected Component.
 - Solving puzzles with one solution.
