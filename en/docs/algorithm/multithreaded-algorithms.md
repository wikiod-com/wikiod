Examples for some multithreaded algorithms.

## Syntax
- **parallel** before a loop means each iteration of the loop are independant from each other and can be run in parallel.
- **spawn** is to indicate creation of a new thread.
- **sync** is to synchronize all created threads.
- Arrays/matrix are indexed 1 to n in examples.

## Square matrix multiplication multithread
    multiply-square-matrix-parallel(A, B)
        n = A.lines         
        C = Matrix(n,n) //create a new matrix n*n
        parallel for i = 1 to n
            parallel for j = 1 to n
                C[i][j] = 0
                pour k = 1 to n
                    C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k]*B[k][j]
        return C

## Multiplication matrix vector multithread
    matrix-vector(A,x)
        n = A.lines
        y = Vector(n) //create a new vector of length n
        parallel for i = 1 to n
            y[i] = 0
        parallel for i = 1 to n
            for j = 1 to n
                y[i] = y[i] + A[i][j]*x[j]
        return y

        

## merge-sort multithread
*A* is an array and *p* and *q* indexes of the array such as you gonna sort the sub-array *A[p..r]*. *B* is a sub-array which will be populated by the sort.

A call to *p-merge-sort(A,p,r,B,s)* sorts elements from *A[p..r]* and put them in *B[s..s+r-p]*.

    p-merge-sort(A,p,r,B,s)
        n = r-p+1
        if n==1
            B[s] = A[p]
        else
            T = new Array(n) //create a new array T of size n
            q = floor((p+r)/2))
            q_prime = q-p+1
            spawn p-merge-sort(A,p,q,T,1)
            p-merge-sort(A,q+1,r,T,q_prime+1)
            sync
            p-merge(T,1,q_prime,q_prime+1,n,B,s)

Here is the auxiliary function that performs the merge in parallel.<br/>
*p-merge*  assumes that the two sub-arrays to merge are in the same array but doesn't assume they are adjacent in the array. That's why we need *p1,r1,p2,r2*. 

    p-merge(T,p1,r1,p2,r2,A,p3)
        n1 = r1-p1+1
        n2 = r2-p2+1
        if n1<n2     //check if n1>=n2
            permute p1 and p2
            permute r1 and r2
            permute n1 and n2
        if n1==0     //both empty?
            return
        else 
            q1 = floor((p1+r1)/2)
            q2 = dichotomic-search(T[q1],T,p2,r2)
            q3 = p3 + (q1-p1) + (q2-p2)
            A[q3] = T[q1]
            spawn p-merge(T,p1,q1-1,p2,q2-1,A,p3)
            p-merge(T,q1+1,r1,q2,r2,A,q3+1)
            sync

And here is the auxiliary function dichotomic-search. 

*x* is the key to look for in the sub-array T[p..r].

    dichotomic-search(x,T,p,r)            
        inf = p
        sup = max(p,r+1)
        while inf<sup
            half = floor((inf+sup)/2)
            if x<=T[half]
                sup = half
            else
                inf = half+1
        return sup
