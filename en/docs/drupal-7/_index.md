This section provides an overview of what drupal-7 is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within drupal-7, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for drupal-7 is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.

Drupal is written in PHP with a great deal of JavaScript (mostly using the JQuery library) for the front-end experience, and it uses a database such as MariaDB/MySQL or PostgreSQL to store both content and configuration.

**Implementation**

To begin building any Drupal website, you first need to install Drupal. Many different combinations of operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X), web servers (Apache, IIS, Nginx), and databases (MariaDB/MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) support Drupal.
