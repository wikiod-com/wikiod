The [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) project consists of:
 - [Polymer library](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview): Polymer is a lightweight library that helps you take full advantage of Web Components. With Web Components, you can create reusable custom elements that interoperate seamlessly with the browserâ€™s built-in elements, or break your app up into right-sized components, making your code cleaner and less expensive to maintain.
 - [WebComponents Polyfill](https://github.com/WebComponents/webcomponentsjs): WebComponents Polyfill is a future targeted library aimed at fulfilling the W3C web components specifications. Browsers that fully implement the specification do not need webcomponents.js. However, most browsers are still missing some part of the spec, so this will be a dependency for quite some time.
 - [Polymer App Toolbox](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/toolbox/): Polymer App Toolbox helps you build and deliver cutting-edge Progressive Web Apps with minimal overhead and payload, by leveraging powerful web platform features like Web Components, Service Worker and HTTP/2. The Toolbox provides a component-based architecture, responsive layouts, a modular router, localization support, turnkey support for local storage and offline caching, and efficient delivery of unbundled app resources. Adopt these features individually, or use them together to build a full-featured Progressive Web App. Polymer sprinkles a bit of sugar over the standard Web Components APIs, making it easier for you to get great results. The Polymer library provides a set of features for creating custom elements. These features are designed to make it easier and faster to make custom elements that work like standard DOM elements. Similar to standard DOM elements, Polymer elements can be:
