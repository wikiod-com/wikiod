[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is a [Read-Evaluate-Print Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) shell for interactive Python development. It supports interactive visualizations using GUI toolkits, and provides a kernel for [Jupyter][3]. It can also be embedded into other projects.

There are other similar REPL shells for Python, for example, [ptpython][1] and [bpython][2].
