Forecasting and time-series analysis may be handled with commonplace functions from the `stats` package, such as `glm()` or a large number of specialized packages. The [CRAN Task View][1] for time-series analysis provides a detailed listing of key packages by topic with short descriptions.

## Creating a ts object
Time series data can be stored as a `ts` object. `ts` objects contain information about seasonal frequency that is used by ARIMA functions. It also allows for calling of elements in the series by date using the `window` command.

    #Create a dummy dataset of 100 observations
    x <- rnorm(100)

    #Convert this vector to a ts object with 100 annual observations
    x <- ts(x, start = c(1900), freq = 1)

    #Convert this vector to a ts object with 100 monthly observations starting in July
    x <- ts(x, start = c(1900, 7), freq = 12)

        #Alternatively, the starting observation can be a number:
        x <- ts(x, start = 1900.5, freq = 12)

    #Convert this vector to a ts object with 100 daily observations and weekly frequency starting in the first week of 1900
    x <- ts(x, start = c(1900, 1), freq = 7)

    #The default plot for a ts object is a line plot    
    plot(x)

    #The window function can call elements or sets of elements by date
        
        #Call the first 4 weeks of 1900
        window(x, start = c(1900, 1), end = (1900, 4))

        #Call only the 10th week in 1900
        window(x, start = c(1900, 10), end = (1900, 10))

        #Call all weeks including and after the 10th week of 1900
        window(x, start = c(1900, 10)) 

It is possible to create `ts` objects with multiple series:

    #Create a dummy matrix of 3 series with 100 observations each
    x <- cbind(rnorm(100), rnorm(100), rnorm(100))
    
    #Create a multi-series ts with annual observation starting in 1900
    x <- ts(x, start = 1900, freq = 1)

    #R will draw a plot for each series in the object
    plot(x)


    
    

## Exploratory Data Analysis with time-series data
    data(AirPassengers)
    class(AirPassengers)
   

> [1] "ts"

In the spirit of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) a good first step is to look at a plot of your time-series data:

    plot(AirPassengers) # plot the raw data
    abline(reg=lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers))) # fit a trend line

For further EDA we examine cycles across years:

    cycle(AirPassengers)
