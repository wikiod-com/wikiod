## Basic map-making with map() from the package maps
The function `map()` from the package `maps` provides a simple starting point for creating maps with R.

A basic world map can be drawn as follows:

    require(maps)
    map()

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

The color of the outline can be changed by setting the color parameter, `col`, to either the character name or hex value of a color:

    require(maps)
    map(col = "cornflowerblue")

[![enter image description here][2]][2]

To fill land masses with the color in `col` we can set `fill = TRUE`:

    require(maps)
    map(fill = TRUE, col = c("cornflowerblue"))

[![enter image description here][3]][3]

A vector of any length may be supplied to `col` when `fill = TRUE` is also set:

    require(maps)
    map(fill = TRUE, col = c("cornflowerblue", "limegreen", "hotpink"))

[![enter image description here][4]][4]

In the example above colors from `col` are assigned arbitrarily to polygons in the map representing regions and colors are recycled if there are fewer colors than polygons.

We can also use color coding to represent a statistical variable, which may optionally be described in a legend. A map created as such is known as a "choropleth".

The following choropleth example sets the first argument of `map()`, which is `database` to `"county"` and `"state"` to color code unemployment using data from the built-in datasets `unemp` and `county.fips` while overlaying state lines in white:

    require(maps)
    if(require(mapproj)) {    # mapproj is used for  projection="polyconic"
      # color US county map by 2009 unemployment rate
      # match counties to map using FIPS county codes
      # Based on J's solution to the "Choropleth Challenge"
      # Code improvements by Hack-R (hack-r.github.io)
      
      # load data
      # unemp includes data for some counties not on the "lower 48 states" county
      # map, such as those in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and some tiny Virginia
      #  cities
      data(unemp)
      data(county.fips)
      
      # define color buckets
      colors = c("paleturquoise", "skyblue", "cornflowerblue", "blueviolet", "hotpink", "darkgrey")
      unemp$colorBuckets <- as.numeric(cut(unemp$unemp, c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 100)))
      leg.txt <- c("<2%", "2-4%", "4-6%", "6-8%", "8-10%", ">10%")
      
      # align data with map definitions by (partial) matching state,county
      # names, which include multiple polygons for some counties
      cnty.fips <- county.fips$fips[match(map("county", plot=FALSE)$names,
                                          county.fips$polyname)]
      colorsmatched <- unemp$colorBuckets[match(cnty.fips, unemp$fips)]
      
      # draw map
      par(mar=c(1, 1, 2, 1) + 0.1)
      map("county", col = colors[colorsmatched], fill = TRUE, resolution = 0,
          lty = 0, projection = "polyconic")
      map("state", col = "white", fill = FALSE, add = TRUE, lty = 1, lwd = 0.1,
          projection="polyconic")
      title("unemployment by county, 2009")
      legend("topright", leg.txt, horiz = TRUE, fill = colors, cex=0.6)
    }

## 50 State Maps and Advanced Choropleths with Google Viz
A common [question][1] is how to juxtapose (combine) physically separate geographical regions on the same map, such as in the case of a choropleth describing all 50 American states (The mainland with Alaska and Hawaii juxtaposed).

Creating an attractive 50 state map is simple when leveraging Google Maps. Interfaces to Google's API include the packages `googleVis`, `ggmap`, and `RgoogleMaps`.

    require(googleVis)
    
    G4 <- gvisGeoChart(CityPopularity, locationvar='City', colorvar='Popularity',
                       options=list(region='US', height=350, 
                                    displayMode='markers',
                                    colorAxis="{values:[200,400,600,800],
                                     colors:[\'red', \'pink\', \'orange',\'green']}")
    ) 
    plot(G4)


[![choropleth][2]][2]

The function `gvisGeoChart()` requires far less coding to create a choropleth compared to older mapping methods, such as `map()` from the package `maps`. The `colorvar` parameter allows easy coloring of a statistical variable, at a level specified by the `locationvar` parameter. The various options passed to `options` as a list allow customization of the map's details such as size (`height`), shape (`markers`), and color coding (`colorAxis` and `colors`).

## Interactive plotly maps
The `plotly` package allows many kind of interactive plots, including maps. There are a few ways to create a map in `plotly`. Either supply the map data yourself (via `plot_ly()` or `ggplotly()`), use plotly's "native" mapping capabilities (via `plot_geo()` or `plot_mapbox()`), or even a combination of both. An example of supplying the map yourself would be:

```
library(plotly)
map_data("county") %>%
    group_by(group) %>%
    plot_ly(x = ~long, y = ~lat) %>%
    add_polygons() %>%
    layout(
        xaxis = list(title = "", showgrid = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
        yaxis = list(title = "", showgrid = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE)
    )
```

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

For a combination of both approaches, swap `plot_ly()` for `plot_geo()` or `plot_mapbox()` in the above example. See the [plotly book](https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/maps.html) for more examples.

The next example is a "strictly native" approach that leverages the [layout.geo](https://plot.ly/r/reference/#layout-geo) attribute to set the aesthetics and zoom level of the map. It also uses the database `world.cities` from `maps` to filter the Brazilian cities and plot them on top of the "native" map.

The main variables: `poph`is a text with the city and its population (which is shown upon mouse hover); `q`is a ordered factor from the population's quantile. `ge` has information for the layout of the maps. See the [package documentation][2] for more information.

    library(maps)
    dfb <- world.cities[world.cities$country.etc=="Brazil",]
    library(plotly)
    dfb$poph <- paste(dfb$name, "Pop", round(dfb$pop/1e6,2), " millions")
    dfb$q <- with(dfb, cut(pop, quantile(pop), include.lowest = T))
    levels(dfb$q) <- paste(c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th"), "Quantile")
    dfb$q <- as.ordered(dfb$q)
    
    ge <- list(
      scope = 'south america',
      showland = TRUE,
      landcolor = toRGB("gray85"),
      subunitwidth = 1,
      countrywidth = 1,
      subunitcolor = toRGB("white"),
      countrycolor = toRGB("white")
    )
    
    plot_geo(dfb, lon = ~long, lat = ~lat, text = ~poph,
        marker = ~list(size = sqrt(pop/10000) + 1, line = list(width = 0)),
        color = ~q, locationmode = 'country names') %>%
    layout(geo = ge, title = 'Populations<br>(Click legend to toggle)')

## Making Dynamic HTML Maps with Leaflet
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) is an open-source JavaScript library for making dynamic maps for the web. RStudio wrote R bindings for Leaflet, available through its [`leaflet` package](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), built with [`htmlwidgets`](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html). Leaflet maps integrate well with the [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) ecosystems.

The interface is [piped](https://www.wikiod.com/r/pipe-operators--and-others), using a `leaflet()` function to initialize a map and subsequent functions adding (or removing) map layers. Many kinds of layers are available, from markers with popups to polygons for creating choropleth maps. Variables in the data.frame passed to `leaflet()` are accessed via function-style `~` quotation.

To map the [`state.name` and `state.center` datasets](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/state.html):

    library(leaflet)
    
    data.frame(state.name, state.center) %>% 
        leaflet() %>% 
        addProviderTiles('Stamen.Watercolor') %>% 
        addMarkers(lng = ~x, lat = ~y, 
                   popup = ~state.name, 
                   clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())

## Dynamic Leaflet maps in Shiny applications

The [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) package is designed to [integerate with Shiny](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html)

In the **ui** you call `leafletOutput()` and in the server you call `renderLeaflet()`
    
    library(shiny)
    library(leaflet)
    
    ui <- fluidPage(
        leafletOutput("my_leaf")
    )
    
    server <- function(input, output, session){
        
        output$my_leaf <- renderLeaflet({
            
            leaflet() %>%
                addProviderTiles('Hydda.Full') %>%
                setView(lat = -37.8, lng = 144.8, zoom = 10)
            
        })
        
    }
    
    shinyApp(ui, server)


However, reactive inputs that affect the `renderLeaflet` expression will cause the entire map to be redrawn each time the reactive element is updated. 

Therefore, to modify a map that's already running you should use the `leafletProxy()` function.


Normally you use `leaflet` to create the static aspects of the map, and `leafletProxy` to manage the dynamic elements, for example:

    library(shiny)
    library(leaflet)
    
    ui <- fluidPage(
        sliderInput(inputId = "slider", 
                    label = "values",
                    min = 0,
                    max = 100,
                    value = 0,
                    step = 1),
        leafletOutput("my_leaf")
    )
    
    server <- function(input, output, session){
        set.seed(123456)
        df <- data.frame(latitude = sample(seq(-38.5, -37.5, by = 0.01), 100),
                         longitude = sample(seq(144.0, 145.0, by = 0.01), 100),
                         value = seq(1,100))
            
        ## create static element
        output$my_leaf <- renderLeaflet({
            
            leaflet() %>%
                addProviderTiles('Hydda.Full') %>%
                setView(lat = -37.8, lng = 144.8, zoom = 8)
            
        })
        
        ## filter data
        df_filtered <- reactive({
            df[df$value >= input$slider, ]
        })
        
        ## respond to the filtered data
        observe({
    
            leafletProxy(mapId = "my_leaf", data = df_filtered()) %>%
                clearMarkers() %>%   ## clear previous markers
                addMarkers()
        })
        
    }
    
    shinyApp(ui, server)
