## Creating a Random Forest model
One example of machine learning algorithms is the Random Forest alogrithm (Breiman, L. (2001). Random Forests. *Machine Learning 45(5)*, p. 5-32). This algorithm is implemented in R according to Breiman's original Fortran implementation in the `randomForest` package. 

Random Forest classifier objects can be created in R by preparing the class variable as `factor`, which is already apparent in the `iris` data set. Therefore we can easily create a Random Forest by:

    library(randomForest)

    rf <- randomForest(x = iris[, 1:4], 
                       y = iris$Species, 
                       ntree = 500, 
                       do.trace = 100)

    rf
    
    # Call:
    #   randomForest(x = iris[, 1:4], y = iris$Species, ntree = 500,      do.trace = 100) 
    # Type of random forest: classification
    # Number of trees: 500
    # No. of variables tried at each split: 2
    # 
    # OOB estimate of  error rate: 4%
    # Confusion matrix:
    #   setosa versicolor virginica class.error
    # setosa         50          0         0        0.00
    # versicolor      0         47         3        0.06
    # virginica       0          3        47        0.06


| parameters | Description |
| :------    | :------ |
| x          | a data frame holding the describing variables of the classes   |
| y          | the classes of the individual obserbations. If this vector is `factor`, a classification model is created, if not a regression model is created.     |
| ntree | The number of individual CART trees built | 
| do.trace | every i*th* step, the out-of-the-box errors overall and for  each class are returned |
