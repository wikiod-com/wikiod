R has many built-in functions to work with probability distributions, with official docs starting at `?Distributions`.

There are generally four prefixes:

 - **d**-The **density** function for the given distribution
 - **p**-The cumulative distribution function
 - **q**-Get the **quantile** associated with the given probability
 - **r**-Get a **random** sample

For the distributions built into R's base installation, see `?Distributions`.

## Normal distribution

Let's use ```*norm``` as an example. From the documentation:

    dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)
    pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
    qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
    rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

So if I wanted to know the value of a standard normal distribution at 0, I would do

    dnorm(0)

Which gives us ```0.3989423```, a reasonable answer.

In the same way ```pnorm(0)``` gives ```.5```. Again, this makes sense, because half of the distribution is to the left of 0.

```qnorm``` will essentially do the opposite of ```pnorm```. ```qnorm(.5)``` gives ```0```.

Finally, there's the ```rnorm``` function:

    rnorm(10)

Will generate 10 samples from standard normal.

If you want to change the parameters of a given distribution, simply change them like so

```rnorm(10, mean=4, sd= 3)```



## Binomial Distribution
We now illustrate the functions `dbinom`,`pbinom`,`qbinom` and `rbinom` defined for *Binomial distribution*.

The `dbinom()` function gives the probabilities for various values of the binomial variable. Minimally it requires three arguments. The first argument for this function must be a vector of quantiles(the possible values of the random variable `X`). The second and third arguments are the `defining parameters` of the distribution, namely, ``n``(the number of independent trials) and ``p``(the probability of success in each trial). For example, for a binomial distribution with ``n = 5``, ``p = 0.5``, the possible values for X are `0,1,2,3,4,5`. That is, the ``dbinom(x,n,p)`` function gives the probability values ```P( X = x )``` for `x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

    #Binom(n = 5, p = 0.5) probabilities
    > n <- 5; p<- 0.5; x <- 0:n
    > dbinom(x,n,p)
    [1] 0.03125 0.15625 0.31250 0.31250 0.15625 0.03125
    #To verify the total probability is 1
    > sum(dbinom(x,n,p))
    [1] 1
    > 
The binomial probability distribution plot can be displayed as in the following figure: 

    > x <- 0:12
    > prob <- dbinom(x,12,.5)
    > barplot(prob,col = "red",ylim = c(0,.2),names.arg=x,
                               main="Binomial Distribution\n(n=12,p=0.5)")

Note that the binomial distribution is symmetric when ```p = 0.5```. To demonstrate that the binomial distribution is negatively skewed when `p` is larger than `0.5`, consider the following example:

    > n=9; p=.7; x=0:n; prob=dbinom(x,n,p);
    > barplot(prob,names.arg = x,main="Binomial Distribution\n(n=9, p=0.7)",col="lightblue")

[![Negatively Skewed Binomial][2]][2]
 
When `p` is smaller than `0.5` the binomial distribution is positively skewed as shown below.

    > n=9; p=.3; x=0:n; prob=dbinom(x,n,p); 
    > barplot(prob,names.arg = x,main="Binomial Distribution\n(n=9, p=0.3)",col="cyan")

We will now illustrate the usage of the cumulative distribution function ```pbinom()```. This function can be used to calculate probabilities such as ```P( X <= x )```. The first argument to this function is a vector of quantiles(values of x).

    # Calculating Probabilities
    # P(X <= 2) in a Bin(n=5,p=0.5) distribution
    > pbinom(2,5,0.5)
    [1] 0.5
The above probability can also be obtained as follows:

    
    # P(X <= 2) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2)
    > sum(dbinom(0:2,5,0.5))
    [1] 0.5

To compute, probabilities of the type: ```P( a <= X <= b )```

    # P(3<= X <= 5) = P(X=3) + P(X=4) + P(X=5) in a Bin(n=9,p=0.6) dist
    > sum(dbinom(c(3,4,5),9,0.6))
    [1] 0.4923556
    > 

 Presenting the binomial distribution in the form of a table:

    > n = 10; p = 0.4; x = 0:n; 
    > prob = dbinom(x,n,p) 
    > cdf = pbinom(x,n,p) 
    > distTable = cbind(x,prob,cdf)
    > distTable
           x         prob         cdf
     [1,]  0 0.0060466176 0.006046618

The `rbinom()` is used to generate random samples of specified sizes with a given parameter values.
