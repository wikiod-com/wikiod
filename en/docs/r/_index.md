# A few features of R that immigrants from other language may find unusual

 - Unlike other languages variables in R need not require type declaration.
 - The same variable can be assigned  different data types at different
   instances of time, if required.
 - Indexing of atomic vectors and lists starts from 1, not 0.
 - R `arrays` (and the special case of matrices) have a `dim` attribute that sets them apart from R's "atomic vectors" which have no attributes.
- A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be **matrices**, **vectors**, **data frames**, **even other lists**, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other in any way.
