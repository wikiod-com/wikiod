[OpenCPU](https://www.opencpu.org/) uses standard R packaging to develop, ship and deploy web applications.


## opencpu Apps
The official website contain good exemple of apps:
https://www.opencpu.org/apps.html

The following code is used to serve a R session:

    library(opencpu)
    opencpu$start(port = 5936)

After this code is executed, you can use URLs to access the functions of the R session.
The result could be XML, html, JSON or some other defined formats.

For exemple, the previous R session can be accessed by a cURL call:

    #curl uses http post method for -X POST or -d "arg=value"
    curl http://localhost:5936/ocpu/library/MASS/scripts/ch01.R -X POST
    curl http://localhost:5936/ocpu/library/stats/R/rnorm -d "n=10&mean=5"

The call is asynchronous, meaning that the R session is not blocked while waiting for the call to finish (contrary to shiny).

The call result is kept in a temporary session stored in `/ocpu/tmp/`

An exemple of how to retrieve the temporary session:

    curl https://public.opencpu.org/ocpu/library/stats/R/rnorm -d n=5
    /ocpu/tmp/x009f9e7630/R/.val
    /ocpu/tmp/x009f9e7630/stdout
    /ocpu/tmp/x009f9e7630/source
    /ocpu/tmp/x009f9e7630/console
    /ocpu/tmp/x009f9e7630/info

`x009f9e7630` is the name of the session.

Pointing to `/ocpu/tmp/x009f9e7630/R/.val` will return the value resulting of `rnorm(5)`, `/ocpu/tmp/x009f9e7630/R/console` will return the content of the console of `rnorm(5)`, etc..
