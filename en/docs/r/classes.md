The class of a data-object determines which functions will process its contents. The `class`-attribute is a character vector, and objects can have zero, one or more classes. If there is no class-attribute, there will still be an implicit class determined by an object's `mode`. The class can be inspected with the function `class` and it can be set or modified by the `class<-` function. The S3 class system was established early in S's history. The more complex S4 class system was established later

There are several functions for inspecting the "type" of an object. The most useful such function is `class`, although sometimes it is necessary to examine the `mode` of an object. Since we are discussing "types", one might think that `typeof` would be useful, but  generally the result from `mode` will be more useful, because objects with no explicit "class"-attribute will have function dispatch determined by the "implicit class" determined by their mode.

## Inspect classes
Every object in R is assigned a class. You can use `class()` to find the object's class and `str()` to see its structure, including the classes it contains. For example:
```
class(iris)
[1] "data.frame"

str(iris)
'data.frame':    150 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
 $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
 $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
 $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
 $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...

class(iris$Species)
[1] "factor"
```

We see that iris has the class `data.frame` and using `str()` allows us to examine the data inside. The variable Species in the iris data frame is of class factor, in contrast to the other variables which are of class numeric. The `str()` function also provides the length of the variables and shows the first couple of observations, while the `class()` function only provides the object's class.


## Vectors and lists
Data in R are stored in vectors. A typical vector is a sequence of values all having the same storage mode (e.g., characters vectors, numeric vectors). See `?atomic` for details on the atomic implicit classes and their corresponding storage modes: `"logical", "integer", "numeric" (synonym "double"), "complex", "character" ` and `"raw"`. Many classes are simply an atomic vector with a `class` attribute on top:

    x <- 1826
    class(x) <- "Date"
    x 
    # [1] "1975-01-01"
     x <- as.Date("1970-01-01")
     class(x)
    #[1] "Date"
     is(x,"Date")
    #[1] TRUE
     is(x,"integer")
    #[1] FALSE
     is(x,"numeric")
    #[1] FALSE
      mode(x)
    #[1] "numeric"

Lists are a special type of vector where each element can be anything, even another list, hence the R term for lists: "recursive vectors":

    mylist <- list( A = c(5,6,7,8), B = letters[1:10], CC = list( 5, "Z") )

Lists have two very important uses:

- Since functions can only return a single value, it is common to return complicated results in a list:

      f <- function(x) list(xplus = x + 10, xsq = x^2)

      f(7)
      # $xplus
      # [1] 17
      # 
      # $xsq
      # [1] 49

- Lists are also the underlying fundamental class for [data frames][1]. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of vectors all having the same length:

      L <- list(x = 1:2, y = c("A","B"))
      DF <- data.frame(L)
      DF
      #   x y
      # 1 1 A
      # 2 2 B
      is.list(DF)
      # [1] TRUE

The other class of recursive vectors is R expressions, which are "language"- objects
