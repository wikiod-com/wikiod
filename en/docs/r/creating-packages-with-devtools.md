This topic will cover the creation of R packages from scratch with the devtools package.

 1. [Official R manual for creating packages](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html)
 2. [`roxygen2` reference manual](http://roxygen.org/roxygen2-manual.pdf)
 3. [`devtools` reference manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/devtools.pdf)

## Creating and distributing packages
This is a *compact guide* about how to quickly create an R package from your code. Exhaustive documentations will be linked when available and should be read if you want a deeper knowledge of the situation. See *Remarks* for more resources.

The directory where your code stands will be refered as `./`, and all the commands are meant to be executed from a R prompt in this folder.


----------

# Creation of the documentation #

The documentation for your code has to be in a format which is very similar to LaTeX.

However, we will use a tool named `roxygen` in order to simplify the process:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
    install.packages("roxygen2")
    library("roxygen2")

The full man page for roxygen is available [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?docex=1&url=http://roxygen.org/roxygen2-manual.pdf). It is very similar to *doxygen*.

Here is a practical sample about how to document a function with *roxygen*:

    #' Increment a variable.
    #'
    #' Note that the behavior of this function
    #' is undefined if `x` is not of class `numeric`.
    #'
    #' @export
    #' @author  another guy
    #' @name    Increment Function
    #' @title   increment
    #'
    #' @param x   Variable to increment
    #' @return    `x` incremented of 1
    #'
    #' @seealso   `other_function`
    #'
    #' @examples
    #' increment(3)
    #' > 4
    increment <- function(x) {
      return (x+1)
    }

And [here will be the result](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qTbT4.png).

It is also recommanded to create a vignette (see the topic *Creating vignettes*), which is a full guide about your package.

----------


# Construction of the package skeleton #

Assuming that your code is written for instance in files `./script1.R` and `./script2.R`, launch the following command in order to create the file tree of your package:

    package.skeleton(name="MyPackage", code_files=c("script1.R","script2.R"))

Then delete all the files in `./MyPackage/man/`.
You have now to compile the documentation:

    roxygenize("MyPackage")

You should also generate a reference manual from your documentation using `R CMD Rd2pdf MyPackage` from a *command prompt* started in `./`.

----------


# Edition of the package properties #

## 1. Package description ##
Modify `./MyPackage/DESCRIPTION` according to your needs. The fields `Package`, `Version`, `License`, `Description`, `Title`, `Author` and `Maintainer` are mandatory, the other are optional. 

*If your package depends on others packages, specify them in a field named `Depends` (R version < 3.2.0) or `Imports` (R version > 3.2.0).*

## 2. Optional folders ##

Once you launched the skeleton build, `./MyPackage/` only had `R/` and `man/` subfolders. However, it can have some others:

 - `data/`: here you can place the data that your library needs and that isn't code. It must be saved as dataset with the `.RData` extension, and you can load it at runtime with [`data()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.4.1/topics/data) and [`load()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.1/topics/load)
 - `tests/`: all the code files in this folder will be ran at install time. If there is any error, the installation will fail.
 - `src/`: for C/C++/Fortran source files you need (using `Rcpp`...).
 - `exec/`: for other executables.
 - `misc/`: for barely everything else.

----------

# Finalization and build #

You can delete `./MyPackage/Read-and-delete-me`.

As it is now, your package is ready to be installed. 

You can install it with `devtools::install("MyPackage")`.

To build your package as a source tarball, you need to execute the following command, from a *command prompt* in `./` : `R CMD build MyPackage`

----------

# Distribution of your package #

## Through Github ##
Simply create a new repository called *MyPackage* and upload everything in `MyPackage/` to the master branch. Here is [an example](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen).

Then anyone can install your package from github with devtools:

    install_package("MyPackage", "your_github_usename")

## Through CRAN ##
Your package needs to comply to the [CRAN Repository Policy](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.1/topics/load). Including but not limited to: your package must be cross-platforms (except some very special cases), it should pass the `R CMD check` test.

Here is the [submission form](https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html). You must upload the source tarball.

## Creating vignettes
> A vignette is a long-form guide to your package. Function
> documentation is great if you know the name of the function you need,
> but itâ€™s useless otherwise. A vignette is like a book chapter or an
> academic paper: it can describe the problem that your package is
> designed to solve, and then show the reader how to solve it.

Vignettes will be created entirely in markdown.

# Requirements #
   

 - Rmarkdown: `install.packages("rmarkdown")`
 - [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.19.2.1)

# Vignette creation

    devtools::use_vignette("MyVignette", "MyPackage")

You can now edit your vignette at `./vignettes/MyVignette.Rmd`.

The text in your vignette is formatted as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

The only addition to the original Markdown, is a tag that takes R code, runs it, captures the output, and translates it into formatted Markdown:

    ```{r}
    # Add two numbers together
    add <- function(a, b) a + b
    add(10, 20)
    ```

Will display as:

```
# Add two numbers together
add <- function(a, b) a + b
add(10, 20)
## [1] 30
```

Thus, all the packages you will use in your vignettes must be listed as dependencies in `./DESCRIPTION`.
