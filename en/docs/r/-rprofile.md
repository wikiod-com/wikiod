There is a nice chapter on the matter in [Efficient R programming](https://bookdown.org/csgillespie/efficientR/set-up.html#r-startup)

## .Rprofile - the first chunk of code executed
`.Rprofile` is a file containing R code that is executed when you launch R from the directory containing the `.Rprofile` file. The similarly named `Rprofile.site`, located in R's home directory, is executed by default every time you load R from any directory. `Rprofile.site` and to a greater extend `.Rprofile` can be used to initialize an R session with personal preferences and various utility functions that you have defined.

> Important note: if you use RStudio, you can have a separate `.Rprofile` in every RStudio project directory.

***

Here are some examples of code that you might include in an .Rprofile file.

# Setting your R home directory

    # set R_home
    Sys.setenv(R_USER="c:/R_home") # just an example directory
    # but don't confuse this with the $R_HOME environment variable.

# Setting page size options
    options(papersize="a4")
    options(editor="notepad")
    options(pager="internal")

# set the default help type
    options(help_type="html")

# set a site library
    .Library.site <- file.path(chartr("\\", "/", R.home()), "site-library")

# Set a CRAN mirror
    local({r <- getOption("repos")
        r["CRAN"] <- "http://my.local.cran"
        options(repos=r)})


# Setting the location of your library

This will allow you to not have to install all the packages again with each R version update. 

    # library location
    .libPaths("c:/R_home/Rpackages/win")

# Custom shortcuts or functions

Sometimes it is useful to have a shortcut for a long R expression. A common example of this setting an active binding to access the last top-level expression result without having to type out `.Last.value`:

    makeActiveBinding(".", function(){.Last.value}, .GlobalEnv)

Because .Rprofile is just an R file, it can contain any arbitrary R code.

# Pre-loading the most useful packages

This is bad practice and should generally be avoided because it separates package loading code from the scripts where those packages are actually used. 

# See Also

See `help(Startup)` for all the different startup scripts, and further aspects.  In particular, two system-wide `Profile` files can be loaded as well.  The first, `Rprofile`,  may contain global settings, the other file `Profile.site` may contain local choices the system administrator can make for all users.  Both files are found in the `${RHOME}/etc` directory of the R installation.  This directory also contains global files `Renviron` and `Renviron.site` which both can be completemented with a local file `~/.Renviron` in the user's home directory.

## .Rprofile example
## Startup

    # Load library setwidth on start - to set the width automatically.
    .First <- function() {
      library(setwidth)
      # If 256 color terminal - use library colorout.
      if (Sys.getenv("TERM") %in% c("xterm-256color", "screen-256color")) {
        library("colorout")
      }
    }

## Options

    # Select default CRAN mirror for package installation.
    options(repos=c(CRAN="https://cran.gis-lab.info/"))

    # Print maximum 1000 elements.
    options(max.print=1000)

    # No scientific notation.
    options(scipen=10)

    # No graphics in menus.
    options(menu.graphics=FALSE)

    # Auto-completion for package names.
    utils::rc.settings(ipck=TRUE)

## Custom Functions

    # Invisible environment to mask defined functions
    .env = new.env()

    # Quit R without asking to save.
    .env$q <- function (save="no", ...) {
      quit(save=save, ...)
    }

    # Attach the environment to enable functions.
    attach(.env, warn.conflicts=FALSE)
