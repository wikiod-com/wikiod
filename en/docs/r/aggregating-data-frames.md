Aggregation is one of the most common uses for R. There are several ways to do so in R, which we will illustrate here.

## Aggregating with base R
For this, we will use the function aggregate, which can be used as follows:

    aggregate(formula,function,data)

The following code shows various ways of using the aggregate function. 

**CODE:**

    df = data.frame(group=c("Group 1","Group 1","Group 2","Group 2","Group 2"), subgroup = c("A","A","A","A","B"),value = c(2,2.5,1,2,1.5))
    
    # sum, grouping by one column
    aggregate(value~group, FUN=sum, data=df)
    
    # mean, grouping by one column
    aggregate(value~group, FUN=mean, data=df)
    
    # sum, grouping by multiple columns
    aggregate(value~group+subgroup,FUN=sum,data=df)
    
    # custom function, grouping by one column
    # in this example we want the sum of all values larger than 2 per group.
    aggregate(value~group, FUN=function(x) sum(x[x>2]), data=df)

**OUTPUT:**

    > df = data.frame(group=c("Group 1","Group 1","Group 2","Group 2","Group 2"), subgroup = c("A","A","A","A","B"),value = c(2,2.5,1,2,1.5))
    > print(df)
        group subgroup value
    1 Group 1        A   2.0
    2 Group 1        A   2.5
    3 Group 2        A   1.0
    4 Group 2        A   2.0
    5 Group 2        B   1.5
    > 
    > # sum, grouping by one column
    > aggregate(value~group, FUN=sum, data=df)
        group value
    1 Group 1   4.5
    2 Group 2   4.5
    > 
    > # mean, grouping by one column
    > aggregate(value~group, FUN=mean, data=df)
        group value
    1 Group 1  2.25
    2 Group 2  1.50
    > 
    > # sum, grouping by multiple columns
    > aggregate(value~group+subgroup,FUN=sum,data=df)
        group subgroup value
    1 Group 1        A   4.5
    2 Group 2        A   3.0
    3 Group 2        B   1.5
    > 
    > # custom function, grouping by one column
    > # in this example we want the sum of all values larger than 2 per group.
    > aggregate(value~group, FUN=function(x) sum(x[x>2]), data=df)
        group value
    1 Group 1   2.5
    2 Group 2   0.0

## Aggregating with dplyr
Aggregating with dplyr is easy! You can use the group_by() and the summarize() functions for this. Some examples are given below.

**CODE:**

    # Aggregating with dplyr
    library(dplyr)
    
    df = data.frame(group=c("Group 1","Group 1","Group 2","Group 2","Group 2"), subgroup = c("A","A","A","A","B"),value = c(2,2.5,1,2,1.5))
    print(df)
    
    # sum, grouping by one column
    df %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(value = sum(value)) %>% as.data.frame()
    
    # mean, grouping by one column
    df %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(value = mean(value)) %>% as.data.frame()
    
    # sum, grouping by multiple columns
    df %>% group_by(group,subgroup) %>% summarize(value = sum(value)) %>% as.data.frame()
    
    # custom function, grouping by one column
    # in this example we want the sum of all values larger than 2 per group.
    df %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(value = sum(value[value>2])) %>% as.data.frame()

**OUTPUT:**

    > library(dplyr)
    > 
    > df = data.frame(group=c("Group 1","Group 1","Group 2","Group 2","Group 2"), subgroup = c("A","A","A","A","B"),value = c(2,2.5,1,2,1.5))
    > print(df)
        group subgroup value
    1 Group 1        A   2.0
    2 Group 1        A   2.5
    3 Group 2        A   1.0
    4 Group 2        A   2.0
    5 Group 2        B   1.5
    > 
    > # sum, grouping by one column
    > df %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(value = sum(value)) %>% as.data.frame()
        group value
    1 Group 1   4.5
    2 Group 2   4.5
    > 
    > # mean, grouping by one column
    > df %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(value = mean(value)) %>% as.data.frame()
        group value
    1 Group 1  2.25
    2 Group 2  1.50
    > 
    > # sum, grouping by multiple columns
    > df %>% group_by(group,subgroup) %>% summarize(value = sum(value)) %>% as.data.frame()
        group subgroup value
    1 Group 1        A   4.5
    2 Group 2        A   3.0
    3 Group 2        B   1.5
    > 
    > # custom function, grouping by one column
    > # in this example we want the sum of all values larger than 2 per group.
    > df %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(value = sum(value[value>2])) %>% as.data.frame()
        group value
    1 Group 1   2.5
    2 Group 2   0.0

## Aggregating with data.table
Grouping with the data.table package is done using the syntax `dt[i, j, by]`
Which can be read out loud as: "*Take dt, subset rows using i, then calculate j, grouped by by.*" Within the dt statement, multiple calculations or groups should be put in a list. Since an alias for `list()` is `.()`, both can be used interchangeably. In the examples below we use `.()`.



**CODE:**

    # Aggregating with data.table
    library(data.table)
    
    dt = data.table(group=c("Group 1","Group 1","Group 2","Group 2","Group 2"), subgroup = c("A","A","A","A","B"),value = c(2,2.5,1,2,1.5))
    print(dt)
    
    # sum, grouping by one column
    dt[,.(value=sum(value)),group]
    
    # mean, grouping by one column
    dt[,.(value=mean(value)),group]
    
    # sum, grouping by multiple columns
    dt[,.(value=sum(value)),.(group,subgroup)]
    
    # custom function, grouping by one column
    # in this example we want the sum of all values larger than 2 per group.
    dt[,.(value=sum(value[value>2])),group]

**OUTPUT:**

    > # Aggregating with data.table
    > library(data.table)
    > 
    > dt = data.table(group=c("Group 1","Group 1","Group 2","Group 2","Group 2"), subgroup = c("A","A","A","A","B"),value = c(2,2.5,1,2,1.5))
    > print(dt)
         group subgroup value
    1: Group 1        A   2.0
    2: Group 1        A   2.5
    3: Group 2        A   1.0
    4: Group 2        A   2.0
    5: Group 2        B   1.5
    > 
    > # sum, grouping by one column
    > dt[,.(value=sum(value)),group]
         group value
    1: Group 1   4.5
    2: Group 2   4.5
    > 
    > # mean, grouping by one column
    > dt[,.(value=mean(value)),group]
         group value
    1: Group 1  2.25
    2: Group 2  1.50
    > 
    > # sum, grouping by multiple columns
    > dt[,.(value=sum(value)),.(group,subgroup)]
         group subgroup value
    1: Group 1        A   4.5
    2: Group 2        A   3.0
    3: Group 2        B   1.5
    > 
    > # custom function, grouping by one column
    > # in this example we want the sum of all values larger than 2 per group.
    > dt[,.(value=sum(value[value>2])),group]
         group value
    1: Group 1   2.5
    2: Group 2   0.0
