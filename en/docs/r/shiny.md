## Create an app
Shiny is an [R][1] package developed by [RStudio][2] that allows the creation of web pages to interactively display the results of an analysis in R.

There are two simple ways to create a Shiny app:  
- in one `.R` file, or 
- in two files: `ui.R` and `server.R`.  

A Shiny app is divided into two parts:   
 - **ui**: A user interface script, controlling the layout and appearance
   of the application.
 - **server**: A server script which contains code to allow the application to react.

# One file

    library(shiny)

    # Create the UI
    ui <- shinyUI(fluidPage(
        # Application title
        titlePanel("Hello World!")
    ))

    # Create the server function
    server <- shinyServer(function(input, output){})

    # Run the app
    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

# Two files

## Create `ui.R` file

    library(shiny)
    
    # Define UI for application
    shinyUI(fluidPage(  
      # Application title
      titlePanel("Hello World!")
    ))

## Create `server.R` file

    library(shiny)
    
    # Define server logic
    shinyServer(function(input, output){})

## Checkbox Group
Create a group of checkboxes that can be used to toggle multiple choices independently. The server will receive the input as a character vector of the selected values.

    library(shiny)

    ui <- fluidPage(    
      checkboxGroupInput("checkGroup1", label = h3("This is a Checkbox group"), 
                     choices = list("1" = 1, "2" = 2, "3" = 3),
                     selected = 1),
      fluidRow(column(3, verbatimTextOutput("text_choice")))
      ) 


    server <- function(input, output){
      output$text_choice <- renderPrint({
        return(paste0("You have chosen the choice ",input$checkGroup1))})
    } 

    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

It's possible to change the settings :

- label : title 
- choices : selected values
- selected : The initially selected value (NULL for no selection)
- inline : horizontal or vertical
- width

It is also possible to add HTML.

## Radio Button
You can create a set of radio buttons used to select an item from a list.

It's possible to change the settings :
- selected : The initially selected value (character(0) for no selection)
- inline : horizontal or vertical
- width 

It is also possible to add HTML.

    library(shiny)

    ui <- fluidPage(    
      radioButtons("radio", 
                   label = HTML('<FONT color="red"><FONT size="5pt">Welcome</FONT></FONT><br> <b>Your favorite color is red ?</b>'),
                   choices = list("TRUE" = 1, "FALSE" = 2),
                   selected = 1,
                   inline = T,
                   width = "100%"),      
      fluidRow(column(3, textOutput("value")))) 


    server <- function(input, output){
      output$value <- renderPrint({
        if(input$radio == 1){return('Great !')}
         else{return("Sorry !")}})}

    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

## Select box
Create a select list that can be used to choose a single or multiple items from a list of values.

    library(shiny)

    ui <- fluidPage(    
      selectInput("id_selectInput", 
              label = HTML('<B><FONT size="3">What is your favorite color ?</FONT></B>'), 
              multiple = TRUE,
              choices = list("red" = "red", "green" = "green", "blue" = "blue", "yellow" = "yellow"), 
              selected = NULL),
      br(), br(),
      fluidRow(column(3, textOutput("text_choice")))) 


    server <- function(input, output){
      output$text_choice <- renderPrint({
        return(input$id_selectInput)})
    }

    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

It's possible to change the settings :

- label : title
- choices : selected values
- selected : The initially selected value (NULL for no selection)
- multiple : TRUE or FALSE
- width
- size
- selectize: TRUE or FALSE (for use or not selectize.js, change the  display)

It is also possible to add HTML.

## Launch a Shiny app
You can launch an application in several ways, depending on how you create you app. If your app is divided in two files `ui.R` and `server.R` or if all of your app is in one file.  
## 1. Two files app  
Your two files `ui.R` and `server.R`have to be in the same folder. You could then launch your app by running in the console the `shinyApp()` function and by passing the path of the directory that contains the Shiny app.

    shinyApp("path_to_the_folder_containing_the_files")  
You can also launch the app directly from Rstudio by pressing the **Run App** button that appear on Rstudio when you an `ui.R` or `server.R` file open.  
[![ClicktoRun][1]][1]  

Or you can simply write `runApp()` on the console if your working directory is Shiny App directory.
## 2. One file app
If you create your in one `R` file  you can also launch it with the `shinyApp()` function.

 - inside of your code :  
 

    library(shiny)
    
    ui <- fluidPage() #Create the ui
    server <- function(input, output){} #create the server
    
    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) #run the App

  

 - in the console by adding path to a `.R` file containing the Shiny application with the paramter `appFile`:   
 

    shinyApp(appFile="path_to_my_R_file_containig_the_app")

## Debugging
`debug()` and `debugonce()` won't work well in the context of most Shiny debugging.  However, `browser()` statements inserted in critical places can give you a lot of insight into how your Shiny code is (not) working.  See also: [Debugging using `browser()`](https://www.wikiod.com/r/debugging#Using browser)

# Showcase mode

[Showcase mode](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/display-modes.html) displays your app alongside the code that generates it and highlights lines of code in server.R as it runs them.

There are two ways to enable Showcase mode:
  -  Launch Shiny app with the argument display.mode = "showcase", e.g., `runApp("MyApp", display.mode = "showcase")`.
  - Create file called  `DESCRIPTION` in your Shiny app folder and add this line in it: ```DisplayMode: Showcase```.

# Reactive Log Visualizer

[Reactive Log Visualizer](http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/showReactLog.html) provides an interactive browser-based tool for visualizing reactive dependencies and execution in your application.
To enable Reactive Log Visualizer, execute `options(shiny.reactlog=TRUE)` in R console and or add that line of code in your server.R file. To start Reactive Log Visualizer, hit Ctrl+F3 on Windows or Command+F3 on Mac when your app is running. Use left and right arrow keys to navigate in Reactive Log Visualizer.
