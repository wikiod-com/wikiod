## Parameters
|Parameter |details |
|----------|------|

|examples | The following lines will be examples on how to use the documented function |
|export | To export the function - i.e. make it callable by users of the package|

## Documenting a package with roxygen2
# Writing with roxygen2

[roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) is a package created by Hadley Wickham to facilitate documentation.

It allows to include the documentation inside the R script, in lines starting by `#'`. The different parameters passed to the documentation start with an `@`, for example the creator of a package will by written as follow:

    #' @author The Author

For example, if we wanted to document the following function:

    mean<-function(x) sum(x)/length(x)

We will want to write a small description to this function, and explain the parameters with the following (each line will be explained and detailed after):

    #' Mean
    #'
    #' A function to compute the mean of a vector
    #' @param x A numeric vector
    #' @keyword mean
    #' @importFrom base sum
    #' @export
    #' @examples
    #' mean(1:3)
    #' \dontrun{ mean(1:1e99) }
    mean<-function(x) sum(x)/length(x)

 - The first line `#' Mean` is the title of the documentation, the following lines make the corpus. 
 - Each parameter of a function must be detailed through a relevant `@param`. `@export` indicated that this function name should be exported, and thus can be called when the package is loaded.
 - `@keyword` provides relevant keywords when looking for help
 - `@importFrom` lists all functions to import from a package that will be used in this function or in you package. Note that importing the complete namespace of a package can be done with `@import`
 - The examples are then written below the `@example` tag.
   * The first one will be evaluated when the package is built;
   * The second one will not - usually to prevent long computations - due to the `\dontrun` command.

# Building the documentation

The documentation can be created using `devtools::document()`. Note also that `devtools::check()` will automatically create a documentation and will report missing arguments in the documentation of functions as warnings.
