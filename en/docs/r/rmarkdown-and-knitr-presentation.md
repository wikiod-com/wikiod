## Adding a footer to an ioslides presentation
Adding a footer is not natively possible. Luckily, we can make use of jQuery and CSS to add a footer to the slides of an ioslides presentation rendered with knitr.
First of all we have to include the jQuery plugin. This is done by the line

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script>

Now we can use jQuery to alter the DOM (_document object model_) of our presentation. In other words: we alter the HTML structure of the document.
As soon as the presentation is loaded (`$(document).ready(function() { ... })`), we select all slides, that do not have the class attributes `.title-slide`, `.backdrop`, or `.segue` and add the tag `<footer></footer>` right before each slide is 'closed' (so before `</slide>`). The attribute `label` carries the content that will be displayed later on.

All we have to do now is to layout our footer with CSS:

After each `<footer>` (`footer::after`):

  - display the content of the attribute `label`
  - use font size 12
  - position the footer (20 pixels from the bottom of the slide and 60 pxs from the left)

  (the other properties can be ignored but might have to be modified if the presentation uses a different style template).

    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
    ```
    
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
    
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
          $('slide:not(.title-slide, .backdrop, .segue)').append('<footer label=\"My amazing footer!\"></footer>');    
        })
    </script>
    
    <style>
      footer:after {
        content: attr(label);
        font-size: 12pt;
        position: absolute;
        bottom: 20px;
        left: 60px;
        line-height: 1.9;
      }
    </style>
    
    
    ## Slide 1
    
    This is slide 1.
    
    ## Slide 2
    
    This is slide 2
    
    # Test
    
    ## Slide 3
    
    And slide 3.


The result will look like this:

## Rstudio example
This is a script saved as .Rmd, on the contrary of r scripts saved as .R.

To knit the script, either use the `render` function or use the shortcut button in Rstudio.

    The header is used to define the general parameters and the metadata.

    ## R Markdown
    
    This is an R Markdown document.
    It is a script written in markdown with the possibility to insert chunk of R code in it.
    To insert R code, it needs to be encapsulated into inverted quote.

    Like that for a long piece of code:
    
    ```{r cars}
    summary(cars)
    ```
    
    And like ``r cat("that")`` for small piece of code.

    ## Including Plots
    
    You can also embed plots, for example:
    
    ```{r echo=FALSE}
    plot(pressure)
    ```
