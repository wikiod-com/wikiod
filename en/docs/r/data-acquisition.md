Get data directly into an R session. One of the nice features of R is the ease of data acquisition. There are several ways data dissemination using R packages.

## Built-in datasets
`R`has a vast collection of built-in datasets. Usually, they are used for teaching purposes to create quick and easily reproducible examples. There is a nice web-page listing the built-in datasets:

https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html

***
# Example

Swiss Fertility and Socioeconomic Indicators (1888) Data. Let's check the difference in fertility based of rurality and domination of Catholic population.

```
library(tidyverse) 

swiss %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = Agriculture, y = Fertility, 
                   color = Catholic > 50))+
        geom_point()+
        stat_ellipse()
```

## Packages to access open databases
Numerous packages are created specifically to access some databases. Using them can save a bunch of time on reading/formating the data. 

***

# Eurostat
Even though `eurostat` package has a function `search_eurostat()`, it does not find all the relevant datasets available. This, it's more convenient to browse the code of a dataset manually at the Eurostat website: [Countries Database][1], or [Regional Database][2]. If the automated download does not work, the data can be grabbed manually at via [Bulk Download Facility][3].

```
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(forcats)
library(eurostat)
library(geofacet)
library(viridis)
library(ggthemes)
library(extrafont)

# download NEET data for countries
neet <- get_eurostat("edat_lfse_22")

neet %>% 
        filter(geo %>% paste %>% nchar == 2,
               sex == "T", age == "Y18-24") %>%
        group_by(geo) %>% 
        mutate(avg = values %>% mean()) %>% 
        ungroup() %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = time %>% year(),
                   y = values))+
        geom_path(aes(group = 1))+
        geom_point(aes(fill = values), pch = 21)+
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2015, 5),
                           labels = c("2000", "'05", "'10", "'15"))+
        scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 40))+
        scale_fill_viridis("NEET, %", option = "B")+
        facet_geo(~ geo, grid = "eu_grid1")+
        labs(x = "Year",
             y = "NEET, %",
             title = "Young people neither in employment nor in education and training in Europe",
             subtitle = "Data: Eurostat Regional Database, 2000-2016",
             caption = "ikashnitsky.github.io")+
        theme_few(base_family =  "Roboto Condensed", base_size = 15)+
        theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
              panel.spacing.x = unit(1, "lines"),
              legend.position = c(0, 0),
              legend.justification = c(0, 0))

## Packages to access restricted data
# Human Mortality Database

[Human Mortality Database][1] is a project of the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research][2] that gathers and pre-process human mortality data for those countries, where more or less reliable statistics is available. 

```
# load required packages
library(tidyverse) 
library(extrafont)
library(HMDHFDplus)

country <- getHMDcountries()

exposures <- list()
for (i in 1: length(country)) {
        cnt <- country[i]
        exposures[[cnt]] <- readHMDweb(cnt, "Exposures_1x1", user_hmd, pass_hmd)
        # let's print the progress
        paste(i,'out of',length(country)) 
} # this will take quite a lot of time
```

Please note, the arguments `user_hmd` and `pass_hmd` are the login credentials at the website of Human Mortality Database. In order to access the data, one needs to create an account at http://www.mortality.org/ and provide their own credentials to the `readHMDweb()` function.

```
sr_age <- list()

for (i in 1:length(exposures)) {
        di <- exposures[[i]]
        sr_agei <- di %>% select(Year,Age,Female,Male) %>% 
                filter(Year %in% 2012) %>%
                select(-Year) %>%
                transmute(country = names(exposures)[i],
                          age = Age, sr_age = Male / Female * 100)
        sr_age[[i]] <- sr_agei
}
sr_age <- bind_rows(sr_age)

# remove optional populations
sr_age <- sr_age %>% filter(!country %in% c("FRACNP","DEUTE","DEUTW","GBRCENW","GBR_NP"))

# summarize all ages older than 90 (too jerky)
sr_age_90 <- sr_age %>% filter(age %in% 90:110) %>% 
        group_by(country) %>% summarise(sr_age = mean(sr_age, na.rm = T)) %>%
        ungroup() %>% transmute(country, age=90, sr_age)

df_plot <- bind_rows(sr_age %>% filter(!age %in% 90:110), sr_age_90)

# finaly - plot
df_plot %>% 
        ggplot(aes(age, sr_age, color = country, group = country))+
        geom_hline(yintercept = 100, color = 'grey50', size = 1)+
        geom_line(size = 1)+
        scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 120), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 120, 20))+
        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 90), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20))+
        xlab('Age')+
        ylab('Sex ratio, males per 100 females')+
        facet_wrap(~country, ncol=6)+
        theme_minimal(base_family = "Roboto Condensed", base_size = 15)+
        theme(legend.position='none',
              panel.border = element_rect(size = .5, fill = NA))

## Datasets within packages
There are packages that include data or are created specifically to disseminate datasets. When such a package is loaded (`library(pkg)`), the attached datasets become available either as R objects; or they need to be called with the `data()` function. 

***
# Gapminder
A nice dataset on the development of countries.

```
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gapminder %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, 
                   color = continent))+
        geom_jitter(size = 1, alpha = .2, width = .75)+
        stat_summary(geom = "path", fun.y = mean, size = 1)+
        theme_minimal()
```
