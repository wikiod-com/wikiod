If you want to routinely apply an R analysis to a lot of separate data files, or provide a repeatable analysis method to other people, an executable R script is a user-friendly way to do so. Instead of you or your user having to call `R` and execute your script inside R via `source(.)`  or a function call, your user may simply call the script itself as if it was a program. 

To represent the standard input-/output channels, use the functions `file("stdin")` (input from terminal or other program via pipe), `stdout()` (standard output) and `stderr()` (standard error). Note that while there is the function `stdin()`, it can not be used when supplying a ready-made script to R, because it will read the next lines of that script instead of user input.

## The basic structure of standalone R program and how to call it
The first standalone R script
==============================

Standalone R scripts are not executed by the program `R` (`R.exe` under Windows), but by a program called `Rscript` (`Rscript.exe`), which is included in your `R` installation by default. 

To hint at this fact, standalone R scripts start with a special line called **Shebang line**, which holds the following content: `#!/usr/bin/env Rscript`. Under Windows, an additional measure is needed, which is detailled later. 

The following simple standalone R script saves a histogram under the file name "hist.png" from numbers it receives as input:

    #!/usr/bin/env Rscript
    
    # User message (\n = end the line)
    cat("Input numbers, separated by space:\n")
    # Read user input as one string (n=1 -> Read only one line)
    input <- readLines(file('stdin'), n=1)
    # Split the string at each space (\\s == any space)
    input <- strsplit(input, "\\s")[[1]]
    # convert the obtained vector of strings to numbers
    input <- as.numeric(input)
    
    # Open the output picture file
    png("hist.png",width=400, height=300)
    # Draw the histogram
    hist(input)
    # Close the output file
    dev.off()
    
You can see several key elements of a standalone R script. In the first line, you see the Shebang line. Followed by that, `cat("....\n")` is used to print a message to the user. Use `file("stdin")` whenever you want to specify "User input on console" as a data origin. This can be used instead of a file name in several data reading functions (`scan`, `read.table`, `read.csv`,...). After the user input is converted from strings to numbers, the plotting begins. There, it can be seen, that plotting commands which are meant to be written to a file must be enclosed in two commands. These are in this case `png(.)` and `dev.off()`. The first function depends on the desired output file format (other common choices being `jpeg(.)` and `pdf(.)`). The second function, `dev.off()` is always required. It writes the plot to the file and ends the plotting process.

Preparing a standalone R script
==============================

Linux/Mac
----------

The standalone script's file must first be made executable. This can happen by right-clicking the file, opening "Properties" in the opening menu and checking the "Executable" checkbox in the "Permissions" tab. Alternatively, the command

    chmod +x PATH/TO/SCRIPT/SCRIPTNAME.R

can be called in a Terminal.

Windows
--------
For each standalone script, a batch file must be written with the following contents:

    "C:\Program Files\R-XXXXXXX\bin\Rscript.exe" "%~dp0\XXXXXXX.R" %*

A batch file is a normal text file, but which has a `*.bat` extension except a `*.txt` extension. Create it using a text editor like `notepad` (not `Word`) or similar and put the file name into quotation marks `"FILENAME.bat"`)  in the save dialog. To edit an existing batch file, right-click on it and select "Edit".
 
You have to adapt the code shown above everywhere `XXX...` is written:
  * Insert the correct folder where your R installation resides
  * Insert the correct name of your script and place it into the same directory as this batch file. 

Explanation of the elements in the code: The first part `"C:\...\Rscript.exe"` tells Windows where to find the `Rscript.exe` program. The second part `"%~dp0\XXX.R"` tells `Rscript` to execute the R script you've written which resides in the same folder as the batch file (`%~dp0` stands for the batch file folder). Finally, `%*` forwards any command line arguments you give to the batch file to the R script.

If you double-click on the batch file, the R script is executed. If you drag files on the batch file, the corresponding file names are given to the R script as command line arguments. 

## Using littler to execute R scripts
[littler](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/littler.html) (pronounced *little r*) ([cran](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/littler/index.html)) provides, besides other features, two possibilities to run R scripts from the command line with littler's `r` command (when one works with Linux or MacOS).

## Installing littler ##
### From R: ### 

    install.packages("littler")

The path of `r` is printed in the terminal, like

    You could link to the 'r' binary installed in
    '/home/*USER*/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/littler/bin/r'
    from '/usr/local/bin' in order to use 'r' for scripting.

To be able to call `r` from the system's command line, a symlink is needed:

    ln -s /home/*USER*/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/littler/bin/r /usr/local/bin/r

### Using apt-get (Debian, Ubuntu): ### 
    sudo apt-get install littler

## Using littler with standard .r scripts ## 
With `r` from `littler` it is possible to execute standalone R scripts without any changes to the script.
Example script:

    # User message (\n = end the line)
    cat("Input numbers, separated by space:\n")
    # Read user input as one string (n=1 -> Read only one line)
    input <- readLines(file('stdin'), n=1)
    # Split the string at each space (\\s == any space)
    input <- strsplit(input, "\\s")[[1]]
    # convert the obtained vector of strings to numbers
    input <- as.numeric(input)
    
    # Open the output picture file
    png("hist.png",width=400, height=300)
    # Draw the histogram
    hist(input)
    # Close the output file
    dev.off()
    

Note that no shebang is at the top of the scripts. When saved as for example `hist.r`, it is directly callable from the system command:

    r hist.r

## Using littler on *shebanged* scripts ##
It is also possible to create executable R scripts with littler, with the use of the shebang

    #!/usr/bin/env r

at the top of the script. The corresponding R script has to be made executable with `chmod +X /path/to/script.r` and is directly callable from the system terminal.
