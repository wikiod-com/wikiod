## JSON to / from R objects
The [`jsonlite` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) is a fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the web. The two main functions used to read and write JSON are `fromJSON()` and `toJSON()` respecitively, and are designed to work with `vectors`, `matrices` and `data.frames`, and streams of JSON from the web.

Create a JSON array from a vector, and vice versa

    library(jsonlite)

    ## vector to JSON
    toJSON(c(1,2,3))
    # [1,2,3]
    
    fromJSON('[1,2,3]')
    # [1] 1 2 3

Create a named JSON array from a list, and vice versa

    toJSON(list(myVec = c(1,2,3)))
    # {"myVec":[1,2,3]}
    
    fromJSON('{"myVec":[1,2,3]}')
    # $myVec
    # [1] 1 2 3

More complex list structures

    ## list structures
    lst <- list(a = c(1,2,3),
                b = list(letters[1:6]))
    
    toJSON(lst)
    # {"a":[1,2,3],"b":[["a","b","c","d","e","f"]]} 
    
    
    fromJSON('{"a":[1,2,3],"b":[["a","b","c","d","e","f"]]} ')
    # $a
    # [1] 1 2 3
    # 
    # $b
    # [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
    # [1,] "a"  "b"  "c"  "d"  "e"  "f" 

Create JSON from a `data.frame`, and vice versa

    ## converting a data.frame to JSON
    df <- data.frame(id = seq_along(1:10),
                     val = letters[1:10])
    
    toJSON(df)
    # [{"id":1,"val":"a"},{"id":2,"val":"b"},{"id":3,"val":"c"},{"id":4,"val":"d"},{"id":5,"val":"e"},{"id":6,"val":"f"},{"id":7,"val":"g"},{"id":8,"val":"h"},{"id":9,"val":"i"},{"id":10,"val":"j"}] 
    
    ## reading a JSON string
    fromJSON('[{"id":1,"val":"a"},{"id":2,"val":"b"},{"id":3,"val":"c"},{"id":4,"val":"d"},{"id":5,"val":"e"},{"id":6,"val":"f"},{"id":7,"val":"g"},{"id":8,"val":"h"},{"id":9,"val":"i"},{"id":10,"val":"j"}]')
    #     id val
    # 1   1   a
    # 2   2   b
    # 3   3   c
    # 4   4   d
    # 5   5   e
    # 6   6   f
    # 7   7   g
    # 8   8   h
    # 9   9   i
    # 10 10   j

Read JSON direct from the internet

    ## Reading JSON from URL
    googleway_issues <- fromJSON("https://api.github.com/repos/SymbolixAU/googleway/issues")
    
    googleway_issues$url
    # [1] "https://api.github.com/repos/SymbolixAU/googleway/issues/20" "https://api.github.com/repos/SymbolixAU/googleway/issues/19"
    # [3] "https://api.github.com/repos/SymbolixAU/googleway/issues/14" "https://api.github.com/repos/SymbolixAU/googleway/issues/11"
    # [5] "https://api.github.com/repos/SymbolixAU/googleway/issues/9"  "https://api.github.com/repos/SymbolixAU/googleway/issues/5" 
    # [7] "https://api.github.com/repos/SymbolixAU/googleway/issues/2"
