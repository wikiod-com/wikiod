When we don't know the value a variable takes, we say its value is missing, indicated by `NA`.

Missing values are represented by the symbol `NA` (not available). Impossible values (e.g., as a result of `sqrt(-1)`) are represented by the symbol `NaN` (not a number).

## Examining missing data
`anyNA` reports whether any missing values are present; while `is.na` reports missing values elementwise:

    vec <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5)

    anyNA(vec)
    # [1] TRUE
    is.na(vec)
    # [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

`Ã¬s.na` returns a logical vector that is coerced to integer values under arithmetic operations (with FALSE=0, TRUE=1). We can use this to find out how many missing values there are:

    sum(is.na(vec))
    # [1] 1

Extending this approach, we can use `colSums` and `is.na` on a [data frame][1] to count NAs per column:

    colSums(is.na(airquality))
    #   Ozone Solar.R    Wind    Temp   Month     Day 
    #      37       7       0       0       0       0 

The [naniar package][2] (currently on github but not CRAN) offers further tools for exploring missing values.

## Reading and writing data with NA values
When reading tabular datasets with the `read.*` functions, R automatically looks for missing values that look like `"NA"`. However, missing values are not always represented by `NA`. Sometimes a dot (`.`), a hyphen(`-`) or a character-value (e.g.: `empty`) indicates that a value is `NA`. The `na.strings` parameter of the `read.*` function can be used to tell R which symbols/characters need to be treated as `NA` values:

    read.csv("name_of_csv_file.csv", na.strings = "-")

It is also possible to indicate that more than one symbol needs to be read as `NA`:

    read.csv('missing.csv', na.strings = c('.','-'))

Similarly, `NA`s can be written with customized strings using the `na` argument to `write.csv`. [Other tools for reading and writing tables][1] have similar options.

## Using NAs of different classes
The symbol `NA` is for a `logical` missing value:

    class(NA)
    #[1] "logical"

This is convenient, since it can easily be coerced to other atomic vector types, and is therefore usually the only `NA` you will need:

    x <- c(1, NA, 1)
    class(x[2])
    #[1] "numeric"

If you do need a single `NA` value of another type, use `NA_character_`, `NA_integer_`, `NA_real_` or `NA_complex_`. For missing values of fancy classes, subsetting with `NA_integer_` usually works; for example, to get a missing-value Date:

    class(Sys.Date()[NA_integer_])
    # [1] "Date"

## TRUE/FALSE and/or NA
`NA` is a logical type and a logical operator with an `NA` will return `NA` if the outcome is ambiguous. Below, `NA OR TRUE` evaluates to `TRUE` because at least one side evaluates to `TRUE`, however `NA OR FALSE` returns `NA` because we do not know whether `NA` would have been `TRUE` or `FALSE`

    NA | TRUE
    # [1] TRUE  
    # TRUE | TRUE is TRUE and FALSE | TRUE is also TRUE.

    NA | FALSE
    # [1] NA  
    # TRUE | FALSE is TRUE but FALSE | FALSE is FALSE.

    NA & TRUE
    # [1] NA  
    # TRUE & TRUE is TRUE but FALSE & TRUE is FALSE.

    NA & FALSE
    # [1] FALSE
    # TRUE & FALSE is FALSE and FALSE & FALSE is also FALSE.

These properties are helpful if you want to subset a data set based on some columns that contain `NA`.

    df <- data.frame(v1=0:9, 
                     v2=c(rep(1:2, each=4), NA, NA), 
                     v3=c(NA, letters[2:10]))

    df[df$v2 == 1 & !is.na(df$v2), ]
    #  v1 v2   v3
    #1  0  1 <NA>
    #2  1  1    b
    #3  2  1    c
    #4  3  1    d

    df[df$v2 == 1, ]
         v1 v2   v3
    #1     0  1 <NA>
    #2     1  1    b
    #3     2  1    c
    #4     3  1    d
    #NA   NA NA <NA>
    #NA.1 NA NA <NA>




## Omitting or replacing missing values
# Recoding missing values

Regularly, missing data isn't coded as `NA` in datasets. In SPSS for example, missing values are often represented by the value `99`.

    num.vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 99, 5)
    num.vec
    ## [1]  1  2  3 99  5
It is possible to directly assign NA using subsetting

    num.vec[num.vec == 99] <- NA
However, the  preferred method is to use `is.na<-` as below. The help file (`?is.na`) states: 
> `is.na<-` may provide a safer way to set missingness. It behaves differently for factors, for example.

    is.na(num.vec) <- num.vec == 99

Both methods return

    num.vec
    ## [1]  1  2  3 NA  5

# Removing missing values

Missing values can be removed in several ways from a vector:

    num.vec[!is.na(num.vec)]
    num.vec[complete.cases(num.vec)]
    na.omit(num.vec)
    ## [1] 1 2 3 5

# Excluding missing values from calculations

When using arithmetic functions on vectors with missing values, a missing value will be returned:

    mean(num.vec) # returns: [1] NA

The `na.rm` parameter tells the function to exclude the `NA` values from the calculation:

    mean(num.vec, na.rm = TRUE) # returns: [1] 2.75

    # an alternative to using 'na.rm = TRUE':
    mean(num.vec[!is.na(num.vec)]) # returns: [1] 2.75

Some R functions, like `lm`, have a `na.action` parameter. The default-value for this is `na.omit`, but with `options(na.action = 'na.exclude')` the default behavior of R can be changed.

If it is not necessary to change the default behavior, but for a specific situation another `na.action` is needed, the `na.action` parameter needs to be included in the function call, e.g.:

     lm(y2 ~ y1, data = anscombe, na.action = 'na.exclude')
