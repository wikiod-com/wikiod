## tidyverse: an overview
# What is `tidyverse`?

[`tidyverse`][1] is the fast and elegant way to turn basic `R` into an enhanced tool, redesigned by Hadley/Rstudio. The development of all packages included in `tidyverse` follow the principle rules of [The tidy tools manifesto][2]. But first, let the authors describe their masterpiece:

> The tidyverse is a set of packages that work in harmony because they
> share common data representations and API design. The tidyverse
> package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages
> from the tidyverse in a single command.
> 
> The best place to learn about all the packages in the tidyverse and
> how they fit together is R for Data Science. Expect to hear more about
> the tidyverse in the coming months as I work on improved package
> websites, making citation easier, and providing a common home for
> discussions about data analysis with the tidyverse.

# How to use it?
Just with the ordinary `R` packages, you need to install and load the package.

    install.package("tidyverse")
    library("tidyverse")

The difference is, on a single command a couple of dozens of packages are installed/loaded. As a bonus, one may rest assured that all the installed/loaded packages are of compatible versions. 

# What are those packages?

The commonly known and widely used packages:

- [ggplot2][4]: advanced data visualisation [SO_doc][5]
- [dplyr][6]: fast ([Rcpp][7]) and coherent approach to data manipulation [SO_doc][8]
- [tidyr][9]: tools for data tidying [SO_doc][10]
- [readr][11]: for data import.
- [purrr][12]: makes your pure functions purr by completing R's functional programming tools with important features from other languages, in the style of the JS packages underscore.js, lodash and lazy.js.
- [tibble][13]: a modern re-imagining of data frames.
- [magrittr][14]: piping to make code more readable [SO_doc][15]

Packages for manipulating specific data formats:

- [hms][16]: easily read times
- [stringr][17]: provide a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as posssible
- [lubridate][18]: advanced date/times manipulations [SO_doc][19]
- [forcats][20]: advanced work with [factors][21].

Data import:

- [DBI][22]: defines a common interface between the R and database management systems (DBMS)
- [haven][23]: easily import SPSS, SAS and Stata files [SO_doc][24]
- [httr][25]: the aim of httr is to provide a wrapper for the curl package, customised to the demands of modern web APIs
- [jsonlite][26]: a fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the web
- [readxl][27]: read.xls and .xlsx files without need for dependency packages [SO_doc][28]
- [rvest][29]: rvest helps you scrape information from web pages [SO_doc][30]
- [xml2][31]: for XML

And modelling:

- [modelr][32]: provides functions that help you create elegant pipelines when modelling
- [broom][33]: easily extract the  models into tidy data

Finally, `tidyverse` suggest the use of:

 - [knitr][34]: the amazing general-purpose literate programming engine, with lightweight API's designed to give users full control of the output without heavy coding work. SO_docs: [one][35], [two][36]
 - [rmarkdown][37]: Rstudio's package for reproducible programming. SO_docs: [one][38], [two][39], [three][40], [four][41]

## Creating tbl_dfâ€™s
A tbl_df (pronounced *tibble diff*) is a variation of a [data frame](https://www.wikiod.com/r/data-frames) that is often used in tidyverse packages. It is implemented in the [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tibble) package.

Use the `as_data_frame` function to turn a data frame into a tbl_df:

    library(tibble)
    mtcars_tbl <- as_data_frame(mtcars)

One of the most notable differences between data.frames and tbl_dfs is how they print:

    # A tibble: 32 x 11
         mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb
    *  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    1   21.0     6 160.0   110  3.90 2.620 16.46     0     1     4     4
    2   21.0     6 160.0   110  3.90 2.875 17.02     0     1     4     4
    3   22.8     4 108.0    93  3.85 2.320 18.61     1     1     4     1
    4   21.4     6 258.0   110  3.08 3.215 19.44     1     0     3     1
    5   18.7     8 360.0   175  3.15 3.440 17.02     0     0     3     2
    6   18.1     6 225.0   105  2.76 3.460 20.22     1     0     3     1
    7   14.3     8 360.0   245  3.21 3.570 15.84     0     0     3     4
    8   24.4     4 146.7    62  3.69 3.190 20.00     1     0     4     2
    9   22.8     4 140.8    95  3.92 3.150 22.90     1     0     4     2
    10  19.2     6 167.6   123  3.92 3.440 18.30     1     0     4     4
    # ... with 22 more rows

* The printed output includes a summary of the dimensions of the table (`32 x 11`)
* It includes the type of each column (`dbl`) 
* It prints a limited number of rows. (To change this use `options(tibble.print_max = [number])`).

Many functions in the dplyr package work naturally with tbl_dfs, such as `group_by()`.
