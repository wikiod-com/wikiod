## Using debug
You can set any function for debugging with `debug`.

```
debug(mean)
mean(1:3)
```

All subsequent calls to the function will enter debugging mode.  You can disable this behavior with `undebug`.

```
undebug(mean)
mean(1:3)
```

If you know you only want to enter the debugging mode of a function once, consider the use of `debugonce`.

```
debugonce(mean)
mean(1:3)
mean(1:3)
```

## Using browser
The `browser` function can be used like a breakpoint: code execution will pause at the point it is called. Then user can then inspect variable values, execute arbitrary R code and step through the code line by line.

Once `browser()` is hit in the code the interactive interpreter will start. Any R code can be run as normal, and in addition the following commands are present,

| Command | Meaning |
| ------ | ------ |
| c   | Exit browser and continue program   |
| f | Finish current loop or function \
| n | Step Over (evaluate next statement, stepping over function calls) |
| s | Step Into (evaluate next statement, stepping into function calls) |
| where | Print stack trace |
| r | Invoke "resume" restart |
| Q | Exit browser and quit |

For example we might have a script like,

    toDebug <- function() {
        a = 1
        b = 2
        
        browser()
        
        for(i in 1:100) {
            a = a * b
        }
    }

    toDebug()

When running the above script we initially see something like,

    Called from: toDebug
    Browser[1]>
    
We could then interact with the prompt as so,

    Called from: toDebug
    Browser[1]> a
    [1] 1
    Browser[1]> b
    [1] 2
    Browse[1]> n
    debug at #7: for (i in 1:100) {
        a = a * b
    }
    Browse[2]> n
    debug at #8: a = a * b
    Browse[2]> a
    [1] 1
    Browse[2]> n
    debug at #8: a = a * b
    Browse[2]> a
    [1] 2
    Browse[2]> Q

`browser()` can also be used as part of a functional chain, like so:

    mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% {browser()}
