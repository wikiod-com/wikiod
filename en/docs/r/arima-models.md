The `Arima` function in the forecast package is more explicit in how it deals with constants, which may make it easier for some users relative to the `arima` function in base R.

ARIMA is a general framework for modeling and making predictions from time series data using (primarily) the series itself. The purpose of the framework is to differentiate short- and long-term dynamics in a series to improve the accuracy and certainty of forecasts. More poetically, ARIMA models provide a method for describing how shocks to a system transmit through time.

From an econometric perspective, ARIMA elements are necessary to correct serial correlation and ensure stationarity.

## Modeling an AR1 Process with Arima
We will model the process

````
#Load the forecast package
library(forecast)
    
#Generate an AR1 process of length n (from Cowpertwait & Meltcalfe)
# Set up variables
set.seed(1234)
n <- 1000
x <- matrix(0,1000,1)
w <- rnorm(n)

# loop to create x
for (t in 2:n) x[t] <- 0.7 * x[t-1] + w[t]
plot(x,type='l')

We will fit an Arima model with autoregressive order 1, 0 degrees of differencing, and an MA order of 0.
