Coercion happens in R when the type of objects are changed during computation either implicitly or by using functions for explicit coercion (such as as.numeric, as.data.frame, etc.). 

## Implicit Coercion
Coercion happens with data types in R, often implicitly, so that the data can accommodate all the values. For example,

    x = 1:3
    x
    [1] 1 2 3
    typeof(x)
    #[1] "integer"

    x[2] = "hi"
    x
    #[1] "1"  "hi" "3" 
    typeof(x)
    #[1] "character"

Notice that at first, `x` is of type `integer`. But when we assigned `x[2] = "hi"`, all the elements of `x` were coerced into `character` as vectors in R can only hold data of single type.
