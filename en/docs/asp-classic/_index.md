Active Server Pages (ASP), also known as Classic ASP or ASP Classic, was Microsoft's first server-side script-engine for dynamically-generated web pages. The introduction of ASP.NET led to use of the term Classic ASP for the original technology.

The default server-side scripting language for ASP is VBScript. The generated pages are meant to be viewed in a browser, so they usually use HTML markup and CSS styling.

<sup>*<sup>1</sup> ASP is not installed by default on these versions of IIS. You need to go into the server manager features and add ASP.
