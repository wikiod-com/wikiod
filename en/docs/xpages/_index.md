XPages is a web Framework for IBM Notes platform. It was introduced in Lotus Domino 8.5 *(has to be verified)*.

It is based on JSF (JavaServer Faces) with a lot of useful extensions to represent and manipulate IBM Notes data.

IBM offers a tutorial for XPages: https://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/dx/Tutorial-intro-to-XPages.htm

**Behind the Scenes**
In backend XPages are XML files which is similar to HTML. The Domino Server finally makes real HTML and send these pages to the Client.
The Business logic is implemented in *native* JavaScript ("clientside JavaScript - CSJS") and *pseudo* JavaScript ("serverside JavaScript - SSJS").
