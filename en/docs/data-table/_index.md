[Data.table][1] is a package for the R statistical computing environment. It extends the functionality of data frames from base R, particularly improving on their performance and syntax. A number of related tasks, including rolling and non-equi joins, are handled in a consistent concise syntax like `DT[where, select|update|do, by]`.

A number of complementary functions are also included in the package:

- I/O: `fread`/`fwrite`
- Reshaping: `melt`/`dcast`/`rbindlist`/`split`
- Runs of values: `rleid`
