**Introduction:**

Triggers are a useful concept in PL/SQL. A trigger is a special type of stored procedure which does not require to be explicitly called by the user. It is a group of instructions, which is automatically fired in response to a specific data modification action on a specific table or relation, or when certain specified conditions are satisfied. 
Triggers help maintain the integrity, and security of data. They make the job convenient by taking the required action automatically. 


## Syntax
 - CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER trigger_name
 - BEFORE UPDATE [or INSERT] [or DELETE]
 - ON table_name
 - [ FOR EACH ROW ]
 - DECLARE
 -   -- variable declarations
 - BEGIN
 -  -- trigger code
 - EXCEPTION
 -  WHEN ...
 -  -- exception handling
 - END;



## Before INSERT or UPDATE trigger
    CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER CORE_MANUAL_BIUR
      BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON CORE_MANUAL
      FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
      if inserting then
        -- only set the current date if it is not specified        
        if :new.created is null then
          :new.created := sysdate;
        end if;
      end if;

      -- always set the modified date to now
      if inserting or updating then
        :new.modified := sysdate;
      end if;
    end;
    /
