## Assignments model in PL/SQL

All programming languages allow us to assign values to variables. Usually, a value is assigned to variable, standing on left side. The prototype of the overall assignment operations in any contemporary programming language looks like this:

    left_operand assignment_operand right_operand instructions_of_stop

This will assign right operand to the left operand. In PL/SQL this operation looks like this:

    left_operand := right_operand;

Left operand **must be always a variable**. Right operand can be value, variable or function:

    set serveroutput on
    declare
      v_hello1 varchar2(32767);
      v_hello2 varchar2(32767);
      v_hello3 varchar2(32767);
      function hello return varchar2 is begin return 'Hello from a function!'; end;
    begin
       -- from a value (string literal)
      v_hello1 := 'Hello from a value!';
       -- from variable
      v_hello2 := v_hello1;
      -- from function
      v_hello3 := hello; 

      dbms_output.put_line(v_hello1);
      dbms_output.put_line(v_hello2);
      dbms_output.put_line(v_hello3);
    end;
    /

When the code block is executed in SQL*Plus the following output is printed in console:

    Hello from a value!
    Hello from a value!
    Hello from a function!


There is a feature in PL/SQL that allow us to assign "from right to the left". It's possible to do in SELECT INTO statement. Prototype of this instrunction you will find below:

    SELECT [ literal | column_value ]
    
    INTO local_variable
    
    FROM [ table_name | aliastable_name ]
    
    WHERE comparison_instructions;

This code will assign character literal to a local variable:

    set serveroutput on
    declare
      v_hello varchar2(32767);
    begin
      select 'Hello world!'
      into v_hello
      from dual;
    
      dbms_output.put_line(v_hello);
    end;
    /
    
When the code block is executed in SQL*Plus the following output is printed in console:

    Hello world!

Asignment "from right to the left" **is not a standard**, but it's valuable feature for programmers and users. Generally it's used when programmer is using cursors in PL/SQL - this technique is used, when we want to return a single scalar value or set of columns in the one line of cursor from SQL cursor.
