Thymeleaf is a template engine, a library written in JAVA. It allows a developer to define a HTML, XHTML or HTML5 page template and later fill it with data to generate final page. Therefore it realizes a *Model-View* part of a [Model-View-Controller][1] pattern.

Thymeleaf's important design principle is that a template itself has to be properly written (X)HTML.
