sails.js is an MVC (Model View Controller) web framework for node.js that emulates familiar MVC frameworks like Ruby on Rails. sails.js is based on Express and provides websocket support via socket.io. 

sails.js provides a set of conventions and default configurations to quickly get a new website project started. It is highly configurable and allows you to easily override the default conventions.

sails.js comes with an ORM called Waterline which abstracts data access. Waterline allows you to use various datastores such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc. and have a clear API for working with your model data.
