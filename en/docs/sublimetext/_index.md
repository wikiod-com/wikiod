What is Sublime Text?
---------------------

Sublime Text is simple but powerful source code editor with a Python application programming interface. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, themes and packages, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.

Why Use Sublime Text?
---------------------

**It is Featureful:**

 - Sublime Text is an extremely featureful text editor. Whether you want multiple cursors or you want a good find/replace or a simple easy incremental search or even editing files over ssh/ftp, you are covered.

**It is Stable:**

 - Text Editor is a very important software. One crash, people would give it a second thought and another crash will be enough to justify remove it totally from ones system. The find/replace/incremental-find/find-in-files are all the areas where performance and stability is important and sublime text has held up.

**It is Mainained:**
    
 - Developers have been pounding releases month on month so steadily that it has created enough eagerness for the next release and the next feature.

**It is Customizable:**

 - Sublime Text 2 is built from the ground up for being highly customizable. From the apparent simple configuration things like displaying line number, code folding etc to some deep software architecture with "vi mode" enabling and a huge list of user settings, it is what you make of it.

 - The fact that the entire user preference is a plain text config file with comments rather than a deeply nested menu also appeals to a lot of programmers/designers.

**It is Innovative:**

 - Be it ability to run the internal commands from the console (`Ctrl+`) or the ability to navigate the command list by name (`Cmd+Shift+P`) in the "command palette" or the multiple cursors as mentioned before are really innovative and gorking just one of these is enough for any user for a huge productivity boost.

**It is Cross Platform:**

 - For something so basic as a text editor, being Cross Platform is a huge positive.

**It is Extendable by Plugins:**

 - Sublime Text 2 has a great plugin architecture. A lot of parts of the editor itself have been implemented as plugins. The syntax highlighting for different languages, the side bar etc.
