This is a description how you can create configuration for you own bundle in the /app/config/config.{yml,xml}

## Create configuration in the app/config/config.yml
    amazingservice:
        url: 'http://amazing.com'
        client_id: 'test_client_1'
        client_secret: 'test_secret'
This is a basic example for create configuration in yml format, for following the yml format you can take deeper configuration.

## Set the config in the created bundle
For instance you have a bundle, which generated by the symfony console. In this case in the DependencyInjection/Configuration.php you have to insert your configuration representation:

    $treeBuilder = new TreeBuilder();
            $rootNode = $treeBuilder->root('amazingservice');
    
            $rootNode->children()
                ->scalarNode('url')->end()
                ->scalarNode('client_id')->end()
                ->scalarNode('client_secret')->end()
                ->end()
            ->end();

Basically in the DependencyInjection/AmazingserviceExtension.php you will see the following lines:

    $configuration = new Configuration();
    $config = $this->processConfiguration($configuration, $configs);

It is not enough for getting the configuration in the Srevices. You have to take it into the container.

    $container->setParameter(
      'amazingservice.config',
      $config
    );
In this case the config in the container, so if your Service getting the container as a constructor parameter:

    base.amazingservice:
            class: Base\AmazingBundle\Services\AmazingServices
            arguments: [@service_container]

Then you can get the configuration in the service with the following code, where the configuration will be an associative array:
   

    private $config;
    
    public function __construct(Container $container){
      $this->config = $container->getParameter('amazingservice.config');   
    }
