Drupal is an open-source content management system built in PHP. Drupal is designed to be flexible and powerful allowing developers to build a wide variety of sites, from blogs and brochure-style sites to complex e-commerce platforms. Through it's community driven modular architecture Drupal is able to provide tools to extend the core functions to help speed development of large and complex projects.

Currently there are two supported versions of Drupal: 7 and 8. Drupal 8 is built on components from the Symfony framework and many other third party libraries to provide modern development structures.
