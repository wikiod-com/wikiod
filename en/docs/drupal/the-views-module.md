The [Views][1] module is a reporting engine which allows site builders to create all sorts of lists. These lists can be formatted as either a block or a page.

To create (design) a view, it is required to enter the desired specifications, such as
Fields, Relationships, Filters, Sort criteria, Displays, etc.
