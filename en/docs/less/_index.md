Less is an open-source pre-processor. It makes writing and maintaining CSS easier by allowing the author to define and use variables, mixins etc. It also has features like Guards using which conditional styles can be written, Loops which help to keep the code DRY and a lot of in-built functions to perform math operations, string and color manipulations etc.

Not to be confused with the Unix tool of the same name.
