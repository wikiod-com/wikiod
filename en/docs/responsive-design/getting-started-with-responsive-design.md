## What is responsive web design?
The term responsive web design was first coined by [Ethan Marcotte][1] in his famous article [Responsive Web Design][2], published in 2010 in [A List Apart][3].

[This Smashing Magazine article][4] by [Kayla Knight][5] describes it as follows:

> Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and
> development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment
> based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists
> of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use
> of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad,
> the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution,
> image size and scripting abilities. In other words, the website should
> have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s
> preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and
> development phase for each new gadget on the market.
