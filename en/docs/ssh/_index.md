The SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic protocol for point-to-point communication over the insecure network (Internet). It [obsoletes][1] the old protocols used in the old days (`rlogin`, `rsh`, `telnet`).

It is commonly used to connect to remote servers, virtual machines or containers in data center or in your private cloud (google compute engine, AWS, ...). But it is also commonly used in conjunction with `git` for accessing and updating your repository securely and easy using public keys instead of passwords.

<sup>It should also mention any large subjects within ssh, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for ssh is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics. TODO</sup>
