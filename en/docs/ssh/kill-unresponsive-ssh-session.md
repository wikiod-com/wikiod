Sometimes your SSH session stops responding. You can easily get out of that session using the following trick.

## Killing an SSH session using the Escape character
By default, the escape character is `~`.

Just go ahead and type `~.` in your opened SSH session.

After hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> your session will end immediately.

Go ahead and try it in any session, it works regardless of the responsiveness of your session.
