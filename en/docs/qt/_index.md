As [official documentation][1] stated, Qt is a cross-platform application development framework for desktop, embedded and mobile. Supported Platforms include Linux, OS X, Windows, VxWorks, QNX, Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Sailfish OS and others.  

 
This section provides an overview of what Qt is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within Qt, and link out to the related topics. Since the documentation for qt is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
