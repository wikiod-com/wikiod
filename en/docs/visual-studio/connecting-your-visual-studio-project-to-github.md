## Publishing your project to a github repository removing sensitive data
the steps in this example will use the following project structure as a demonstration  
 [![dummy solution][1]][1]
 
 and we intend to export it to the "GHTuts" Repository [Note that the Repo doesn't exist yet on github] but leave the "SensitiveProject" without publish as it contains some passwords, keys, etc..
 
 1. First of all we make sure the source control plug in is set to "Git" in "Tools > Options > Plug-in Selection"  [![enter image description here][2]][2]
 2. If you can't see the "Team Explorer" tab, view it in visual studio like this
 [![enter image description here][3]][3]
 -----------------------------------------------
 1. Go to your local solution folder and create a new file called ".gitignore.txt"
 [Note]
 this step is only important if you have some sensitive information in your project,otherwise, let visual studio create it for you
 
 2. Now open the ".gitignore.txt" file and paste this in it, this is a template for ignoring common visual studio files (check the links below)

 3. Now add your sensitive project folder to the ".gitignore.txt" file at any line that doesn't contain `#`, so just add it at the very end, and it should look something like this
 
 [![enter image description here][4]][4]
 
 4. Right click on the solution and choose "Add Solution to Source Control..."
 [![enter image description here][5]][5]
 [Note]
 it might ask you to save the solution before you continue
 
 5. Now you have a "LOCAL" git Repo on your pc , which VS will read from,but without a github Repo, and you will see a small blue lock icon next to each file in the solution that was added to git and a red circle at the ignored project  
 [![enter image description here][6]][6]  
 
     [Note]  
     for more information about .gitignore file, check these links
 
 - https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/
 - https://github.com/github/gitignore
 
 7. Go to the "Team Explorer" tab and then "Sync"
 
 8. Now we create a repo from vs to github like this, press the "Get Started" button
 [![enter image description here][7]][7]
 
 9. Now fill in your information in github for the new Repo, then click "Publish"
 [![enter image description here][8]][8]
 
 10. Now when we go to github we see our local repo got published to github without our sensitive project
 [Note]  
 the url of the repo will look something like this  
 `https://github.com/<user name>/<repo name>`
