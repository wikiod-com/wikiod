[Elm][1] is a friendly functional programming language compiling to JavaScript. Elm focuses on browser-based GUIs, single-page applications.

Users usually praise it for:

- No runtime exceptions.
- [Best compiler errors ever](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans)
- The ease of refactoring.
- [Expressive type system](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/how-elm-slays-a-ui-antipattern.html)
- [The Elm Architecture](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/), which Redux is inspired by.
