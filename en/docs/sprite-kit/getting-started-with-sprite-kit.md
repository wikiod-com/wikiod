Press **Next**.

 - Write into `Product Name` the name of your first great game.
 - Into `Organization Name` the name of your company (or simply your own name).
 - `Organisation Identifier` should contain your *reversed* domain name (`www.yourdomain.com` becomes `com.yourdomain`). If you don't have a domain write anything you want (this is just and test).
 - Then select `Swift`, `SpriteKit` and `iPhone`.
