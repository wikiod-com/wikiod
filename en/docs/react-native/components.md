## Basic Component
    import React, { Component } from 'react'
    import { View, Text, AppRegistry } from 'react-native'

    class Example extends Component {
      render () {
        return (
          <View> 
            <Text> I'm a basic Component </Text>
          </View>
        )
      }
    }

    AppRegistry.registerComponent('Example', () => Example)


## Stateful Component
These components will have changing States.

    import React, { Component } from 'react'
    import { View, Text, AppRegistry } from 'react-native'

    class Example extends Component {
      constructor (props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = {
          name: "Sriraman"
        }  
      }
      render () {
        return (
          <View>
            <Text> Hi, {this.state.name}</Text>
          </View>
        )
      }
    }

    AppRegistry.registerComponent('Example', () => Example)

## Stateless Component
As the name implies, Stateless Components do not have any local state. They are also known as **Dumb Components**. Without any local state, these components do not need lifecycle methods or much of the boilerplate that comes with a stateful component.

Class syntax is not required, you can simply do `const name = ({props}) => ( ... )`. Generally stateless components are more concise as a result. 

Beneath is an example of two stateless components `App` and `Title`, with a demonstration of passing props between components:
    
    import React from 'react'
    import { View, Text, AppRegistry } from 'react-native'

    const Title = ({Message}) => (
      <Text>{Message}</Text>
    )    

    const App = () => (
      <View>
        <Title title='Example Stateless Component' />
      </View>
    )

    AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App)

This is the recommended pattern for components, when possible. As in the future optimisations can be made for these components, reducing memory allocations and unnecessary checks.
