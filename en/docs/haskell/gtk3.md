## Syntax
- obj <- < widgetName >New -- How widgets (e.g Windows, Buttons, Grids) are created

- set < widget > [ < attributes > ] -- Set attributes as defined as Attr self in widget documentation (e.g. buttonLabel)

- on < widget > < event > < IO action > -- Adding an IO action to a widgets Signal self (e.g. buttonActivated)




On many Linux distributions, the Haskell Gtk3 library is available as a package in the systems package manager (e.g. `libghc-gtk` in Ubuntu's APT). However, for some developers it might be preferable to use a tool like `stack` to manage isolated environments, and have Gtk3 installed via `cabal` instead of via an global installation by the systems package manager. For this option, `gtk2hs-buildtools` is required. Run `cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools` before adding `gtk`, `gtk3` or any other Gtk-based Haskell libraries to your projects `build-depends` entry in your cabal file.
    

## Hello World in Gtk
This example show how one may create a simple "Hello World" in Gtk3, setting up a window and button widgets. The sample code will also demonstrate how to set different attributes and actions on the widgets.
<!-- language: haskell-lang -->

    module Main (Main.main) where
    
    import Graphics.UI.Gtk
    
    main :: IO ()
    main = do
      initGUI
      window <- windowNew
      on window objectDestroy mainQuit
      set window [ containerBorderWidth := 10, windowTitle := "Hello World" ]
      button <- buttonNew
      set button [ buttonLabel := "Hello World" ]
      on button buttonActivated $ do
        putStrLn "A \"clicked\"-handler to say \"destroy\""
        widgetDestroy window
      set window [ containerChild := button ]
      widgetShowAll window
      mainGUI -- main loop
