GHCâ€™s type system supports arbitrary-rank explicit universal quantification in types through the use of the `Rank2Types` and `RankNTypes` language extensions.

## Syntax
- Arbitrary rank quantification is enabled with either the `Rank2Types` or `RankNTypes` language extension. 
- With this extension enabled, the `forall` keyword can be used to add higher-rank quantification.

## RankNTypes
StackOverflow forces me to have one example. If this topic is approved, we should move [this][1] example here.
