## Use Case for Phantom Types: Currencies
Phantom types are useful for dealing with data, that has identical representations but isn't logically of the same type.

A good example is dealing with currencies. If you work with currencies you absolutely never want to e.g. add two amounts of different currencies. What would the result currency of ```5.32â‚¬ + 2.94$``` be? It's not defined and there is no good reason to do this.

A solution to this could look something like this:

    {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
    
    data USD
    data EUR

    newtype Amount a = Amount Double
                     deriving (Show, Eq, Ord, Num)

The `GeneralisedNewtypeDeriving` extension allows us to derive `Num` for the `Amount` type. GHC reuses `Double`'s `Num` instance.

Now if you represent Euro amounts with e.g. ```(5.0 :: Amount EUR)``` you have solved the problem of keeping double amounts separate at the type level without introducing overhead. Stuff like ```(1.13 :: Amount EUR) + (5.30 :: Amount USD)``` will result in a type error and require you to deal with currency conversion appropriately.
