## Profiling with Stack
Configure profiling for a project via `stack`. First build the project with the `--profile` flag:

    stack build --profile

GHC flags are not required in the cabal file for this to work (like `-prof`). `stack` will automatically turn on profiling for both the library and executables in the project. The next time an executable runs in the project, the usual `+RTS` flags can be used:

    stack exec -- my-bin +RTS -p

## Structure
# File structure

A simple project has the following files included in it:

    âžœ  helloworld ls 
    LICENSE          Setup.hs         helloworld.cabal src              stack.yaml

In the folder `src` there is a file named `Main.hs`. This is the "starting point" of the `helloworld` project. By default `Main.hs` contains a simple "Hello, World!" program.

**Main.hs**

    module Main where
    
    main :: IO ()
    main = do
      putStrLn "hello world"

# Running the program

Make sure you are in the directory `helloworld` and run:

    stack build # Compile the program
    stack exec helloworld # Run the program
    # prints "hello world"

## Build and Run a Stack Project
In this example our project name is "helloworld" which was created with `stack new helloworld simple`

First we have to build the project with `stack build` and then we can run it with

    stack exec helloworld-exe

## Viewing dependencies
To find out what packages your project directly depends on, you can simply use this command:

    stack list-dependencies

This way you can find out what version of your dependencies where actually pulled down by stack.

Haskell projects frequently find themselves pulling in a lot of libraries indirectly, and sometimes these external dependencies cause problems that you need to track down. If you find yourself with a rogue external dependency that you'd like to identify, you can grep through the entire dependency graph and identify which of your dependencies is ultimately pulling in the undesired package:

    stack dot --external | grep template-haskell

`stack dot` prints out a dependency graph in text form that can be searched. It can also be viewed:

    stack dot --external | dot -Tpng -o my-project.png

You can also set the depth of the dependency graph if you want:

    stack dot --external --depth 3 | dot -Tpng -o my-project.png

## Installing Stack
**Mac OSX**

Using [Homebrew][1]:

    brew install haskell-stack


  [1]: http://brew.sh/

## Creating a simple project
To create a project called **helloworld** run:

    stack new helloworld simple

This will create a directory called `helloworld` with the files necessary for a Stack project.



## Stack install
By running the command 

    stack install 

Stack will copy a executable file to the folder 

    /Users/<yourusername>/.local/bin/

## Stackage Packages and changing the LTS (resolver) version
[Stackage][1] is a repository for Haskell packages. We can add these packages to a stack project.

# Adding lens to a project.

In a stack project, there is a file called `stack.yaml`. In `stack.yaml` there is a segment that looks like:

    resolver: lts-6.8

Stackage keeps a list of packages for every revision of `lts`. In our case we want the list of packages for `lts-6.8` To find these packages visit:

    https://www.stackage.org/lts-6.8 # if a different version is used, change 6.8 to the correct resolver number.

Looking through the packages, there is a [Lens-4.13][2].

We can now add the language package by modifying the section of `helloworld.cabal`:

      build-depends: base >= 4.7 && < 5

to:

      build-depends: base >= 4.7 && 5,
                     lens == 4.13


Obviously, if we want to change a newer LTS (after it's released), we just change the resolver number, eg.:
    
    resolver: lts-6.9

With the next `stack build` Stack will use the LTS 6.9 version and hence download some new dependencies.
