[**Haskell**][2] is an advanced purely-functional programming language.

# Features:

- **Statically typed:** Every expression in Haskell has a type which is determined at compile time. Static type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs.
- **Purely functional**: Every function in Haskell is a function in the mathematical sense. There are no statements or instructions, only expressions which cannot mutate variables (local or global) nor access state like time or random numbers.
- **Concurrent:** Its flagship compiler, GHC, comes with a high-performance parallel garbage collector and light-weight concurrency library containing a number of useful concurrency primitives and abstractions.
- **Lazy evaluation:** Functions don't evaluate their arguments. Delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed.
- **General-purpose:** Haskell is built to be used in all contexts and environments.
- **Packages:** Open source contribution to Haskell is very active with a wide range of packages available on the public package servers.

The latest standard of Haskell is Haskell 2010. As of May 2016, a group is working on the next version, Haskell 2020.

The [official Haskell documentation][3] is also a comprehensive and useful resource. Great place to find books, courses, tutorials, manuals, guides, etc.
