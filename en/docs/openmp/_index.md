OpenMP (Open MultiProcessing) is a parallel programming model based on compiler directives which allows application developers to incrementally add parallelism to their application codes.

OpenMP API specification for parallel programming provides an application programming interface (API) that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran, on most platforms. It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables that influence run-time behavior.

Since OpenMP focuses on the parallelism within a node (shared memory multiprocessing) it can be combined with message-passing programming models, such as MPI, to execute on multiple nodes.
