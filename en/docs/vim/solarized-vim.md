Spending most of the time on terminal can be a big deal for eyes. Wisely choosing color scheme can benefit your eyes in many ways. Recently I ran into [`Solarized ColorScheme for Vim`](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/vim-colors-solarized). Adding this small plugin can make a big difference on text appearance on terminal. Many thanks to Ethan Schoonover for developing this package. The `howtos` are explained pretty well [here](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized). Enjoy!


## .vimrc
Solarized has two options - light and dark mode.

**[Light Mode](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/img/screen-haskell-light.png):**

    syntax enable
    set background=light
    colorscheme solarized 

**[Dark Mode](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/img/screen-haskell-dark.png):**

    syntax enable
    set background=dark
    colorscheme solarized
