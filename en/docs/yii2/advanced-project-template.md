## Deployment in shared hosting environment
Deploying an advanced project template to shared hosting is a bit trickier than a basic one because it has two webroots, which shared hosting webservers don't support. We will need to adjust the directory structure so frontend URL will be http://site.local and backend URL will be http://site.local/admin.

## Move entry scripts into single webroot
First of all we need a webroot directory. Create a new directory and name it to match your hosting webroot name, e.g., www or public_html or the like. Then create the following structure where www is the hosting webroot directory you just created:

    www
        admin
    backend
    common
    console
    environments
    frontend
    ...

> **www** will be our frontend directory so move the contents of **frontend/web** into it. Move the contents of **backend/web** into **www/admin**. In each case you will need to adjust the paths in **index.php** and **index-test.php**.

## Adjust sessions and cookies

Originally the backend and frontend are intended to run at different domains. When weâ€™re moving it all to the same domain the frontend and backend will be sharing the same cookies, creating a clash. In order to fix it, adjust backend application **config backend/config/main.php** as follows:

    'components' => [
        'request' => [
            'csrfParam' => '_csrf-backend',
            'csrfCookie' => [
                'httpOnly' => true,
                'path' => '/admin',
            ],
        ],
        'user' => [
            'identityClass' => 'common\models\User',
            'enableAutoLogin' => true,
            'identityCookie' => [
                'name' => '_identity-backend',
                'path' => '/admin',
                'httpOnly' => true,
            ],
        ],
        'session' => [
            // this is the name of the session cookie used for login on the backend
            'name' => 'advanced-backend',
            'cookieParams' => [
                'path' => '/admin',
            ],
        ],
    ],

Hope this helps for the shared hosting users to deploy advanced application.

## Sharing uploaded files between the frontend and backend using symlinks
So you've uploaded your files to a folder say `/backend/web/uploads/` and you want these uploads to be visible on the frontend too. The easiest option is to create a symlink in the frontend that links to the backend:

    ln -s /path/to/backend/web/uploads/ /path/to/frontend/web/uploads

In your views you can use relative links to the files now:

    <img src='/uploads/<?= $model->image?>' alt='My Image goes here'>
    <a href='/uploads/<?= $model->filename?>' target='_blank'>Download File</a>

Ensure that your webserver allows symlinks to be followed.
