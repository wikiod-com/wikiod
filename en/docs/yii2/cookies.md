Cookies are part of HTTP request so it's a good idea to do both in controller which responsibility is exactly dealing with request and response.

## Cross-subdomain authentication and identity cookies
In case of autologin or "remember me" cookie, the same quirks as in case of subdomain cookies are applying.
But this time you need to configure user component, setting `identityCookie` array to desired cookie config.

Open you application config file and add `identityCookie` parameters to user component configuration:

```php
$config = [
    // ...
    'components' => [
        // ...
        'user' => [
            'class' => 'yii\web\User',
            'identityClass' => 'app\models\User',
            'enableAutoLogin' => true,
            'loginUrl' => '/user/login',
            'identityCookie' => [ // <---- here!
                'name' => '_identity',
                'httpOnly' => true,
                'domain' => '.example.com',
            ],
        ],
        'request' => [
            'cookieValidationKey' => 'your_validation_key'
        ],
        'session' => [
            'cookieParams' => [
                'domain' => '.example.com',
                'httpOnly' => true,
            ],
        ],

    ],
];
```

Note that `cookieValidationKey` should be the same for all sub-domains.

Note that you have to configure the `session::cookieParams` property to have the samedomain as your `user::identityCookie` to ensure the `login` and `logout` work for all subdomains. This behavior is better explained on the next section.

## Reading a cookie
In order to read a cookie use the following code:

```php
$value = \Yii::$app->getRequest()->getCookies()->getValue('my_cookie');
```

**Note:** this code allows read cookies that has been set using cookie component (because it signs all cookies by default). Therefore if you add/update cookie using JS code, you can't read it using this method (by default).


## Cookies for subdomains
Because of security reasons, by default cookies are accessible only on the same domain from which they were set.
For example, if you have set a cookie on domain `example.com`, you cannot get it on domain `www.example.com`.
So if you're planning to use subdomains (i.e. admin.example.com, profile.example.com), you need to set `domain`
explicitly:

```php
$cookie = new Cookie([
    'name' => 'cookie_monster',
    'value' => 'Me want cookie everywhere!',
    'expire' => time() + 86400 * 365,
    'domain' => '.example.com' // <<<=== HERE
]);
\Yii::$app->getResponse()->getCookies()->add($cookie);
```

Now cookie can be read from all subdomains of `example.com`.

## Setting a cookie
To set a cookie i.e. to create it and schedule for sending to the browser you need to create new `\yii\web\Cookie` class instance and add it to response cookies collection:

```php
$cookie = new Cookie([
    'name' => 'cookie_monster',
    'value' => 'Me want cookie!',
    'expire' => time() + 86400 * 365,
]);
\Yii::$app->getResponse()->getCookies()->add($cookie);
```

In the above we're passing parameters to cookie class constructor. These basically the same as used with native PHP [setcookie](http://php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php) function:

- `name` - name of the cookie.
- `value` - value of the cookie. Make sure it's a string. Browsers typically aren't happy about binary data in cookies.
- `domain` - domain you're setting the cookie for.
- `expire` - unix timestamp indicating time when the cookie should be automatically deleted.
- `path` - the path on the server in which the cookie will be available on.
- `secure` - if `true`, cookie will be set only if HTTPS is used.
- `httpOnly` - if `true`, cookie will not be available via JavaScript.

## Session cookie parameters
Session cookies parameters are important both if you have a need to maintain session while getting from one
subdomain to another or when, in contrary, you host backend app under `/admin` URL and want handle session
separately.

```php
$config = [
    // ...
    'components' => [
        // ...
        'session' => [
            'name' => 'admin_session',
            'cookieParams' => [
                'httpOnly' => true,
                'path' => '/admin',
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```
