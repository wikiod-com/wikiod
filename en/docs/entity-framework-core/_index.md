Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight and extensible version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

EF Core is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.
