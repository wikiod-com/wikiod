A web-service is a web application component that enables communication between applications for integration purposes.

Web-services follow a client-server architecture. An application "offers" a web-service (server) and other applications "consume" the web-service (client).

They are implemented over [HTTP][1] using requests and responses.

The main types of web-services are:

 - [SOAP][2] (**S**imple **O**bject **A**ccess **P**rotocol)
 - [REST][3] (**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer)
