## How to add users and groups to an existing Bitbucket repository
 1. Go to the Bitbucket repository you want to add users to.
 2. On the left, go to **Settings** (the last icon on the bottom left).
 3. Select **Users and group access**.
 4. Under *Users*, start typing the name or email address of the user whom you want to add.
 5. Select the privilege you want to grant that user (**Read**, **Write** or **Admin**).
 6. Click **Add**.

Follow the same basic procedure to add a group instead of a user.

Now you have added more collaborators to your repository.
