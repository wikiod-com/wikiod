## Import existing repository to Bitbucket
 1. Go to the repository you want to clone (something like:
    https://bitbucket.org/username/repo)
 2. On the top menu, choose *Repository* -> *Import repository*
 3. In the Old repository section, enter the source (CodePlex, Git, Google Code, Mercurial, Source Code, Subversion) and the URL 
 4. In the New repository section, enter the Owner, the repository name, the access level 

> (note: each one of the sources in step 3 has different inputs that needs to be
> added, in our example, we are focusing only on Git)
