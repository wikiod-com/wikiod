This document covers TCP/IP networking, network administration and system configuration basics. Linux can support multiple network devices. The device names are numbered and begin at zero and count upwards. For example, a computer with two NICs will have two devices labeled eth0 and eth1.


## Interface details
**Ifconfig**

List all the interfaces available on the machine

`$ ifconfig -a`

List the details of a specific interface

Syntax: `$ ifconfig <interface>`

Example: 
```
$ ifconfig eth0
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  
          inet addr:x.x.x.x  Bcast:x.x.x.x  Mask:x.x.x.x
          inet6 addr: xxxx::xxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:4426618 errors:0 dropped:1124 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:189171 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:382611580 (382.6 MB)  TX bytes:36923665 (36.9 MB)
          Interrupt:16 Memory:fb5e0000-fb600000 
```

```
----------

**ip - show / manipulate routing, devices, policy routing and tunnels**

Syntax: `$ ip { link | ... | route | macsec }` (please see `man ip` for full list of objects)


Examples

List network interfaces

    $ ip link show    

Rename interface eth0 to wan

    $ ip link set dev eth0 name wan    

Bring interface eth0 up (or down)

    $ ip link set dev eth0 up    

List addresses for interfaces

    $ ip addr show    

Add (or del) ip and mask (255.255.255.0)

    $ ip addr add 1.2.3.4/24 brd + dev eth0 


## Adding IP to an interface
An IP address to an interface could be obtained via DHCP or Static assignment

----------

**DHCP**
If you are connected to a network with a DHCP server running, `dhclient` command can get an IP address for your interface

`$ dhclient <interface>`

or alternatively, you could make a change to the `/etc/network/interfaces` file for the interface to be brought up on boot and obtain DHCP IP

```
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```

----------

**Static configuration(Permanent Change) using `/etc/network/interfaces` file**

If you want to statically configure the interface settings(permanent change), you could do so in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file.

Example:

```
auto eth0 # Bring up the interface on boot
iface eth0 inet static 
    address 10.10.70.10
    netmask 255.255.0.0
    gateway 10.10.1.1
    dns-nameservers 10.10.1.20
    dns-nameservers 10.10.1.30
```
These changes persist even after system reboot.

----------

**Static configuration(Temporary change) using `ifconfig` utility**

A static IP address could be added to an interface using the `ifconfig` utility as follows

`$ ifconfig <interface> <ip-address>/<mask> up`

Example:

`$ ifconfig eth0 10.10.50.100/16 up`


## Local DNS resolution
File: `/etc/hosts` contains a list of hosts that are to be resolved locally(not by DNS)

Sample contents of the file:

```
127.0.0.1         your-node-name.your-domain.com  localhost.localdomain  localhost 
XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX   node-name
```
The file format for the hosts file is specified by [RFC 952][1]


  [1]: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0952.txt

## Configure DNS servers for domain name resolution
File: `/etc/resolv.conf` contains a list of DNS servers for domain name resolution

Sample contents of the file:

```
nameserver 8.8.8.8 # IP address of the primary name server
nameserver 8.8.4.4 # IP address of the secondary name server
```

In case internal DNS server you can validate if this server resolve DNS names properly using `dig` command: 

    $ dig google.com @your.dns.server.com +short

## See and manipulate routes
# Manipulate the IP routing table using `route`
**Display routing table**

```
$ route # Displays list or routes and also resolves host names
$ route -n # Displays list of routes without resolving host names for faster results
```

**Add/Delete route**

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `add` or `del`  | Add or delete a route |
| `-host x.x.x.x` | Add route to a single host identified by the IP address | 
| `-net x.x.x.x` | Add route to a network identified by the network address |
| `gw x.x.x.x` | Specify the network gateway |
| `netmask x.x.x.x` | Specify the network netmask |
| `default` | Add a default route |

Examples:

 - add route to a host `$ route add -host x.x.x.x eth1`
 - add route to a network `$ route add -net 2.2.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0`
 - Alternatively, you could also use cidr format to add a route to network `route add -net 2.2.2.0/24 eth0`
 - add default gateway `$ route add default gw 2.2.2.1 eth0`
 - delete a route `$ route del -net 2.2.2.0/24`

# Manipulate the IP routing table using `ip`

**Display routing table**


    $ ip route show # List routing table

 

**Add/Delete route**

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `add` or `del` or `change` or `append` or `replace` | Change a route |
| `show` or `flush` | the command displays the contents of the routing tables or remove it | 
| `restore` | restore routing table information from stdin |
| `get` | this command gets a single route to a destination and prints its contents exactly as the kernel sees it |

Examples:

 - Set default gateway to 1.2.3.254 `$ ip route add default via 1.2.3.254`
 - Adds a default route (for all addresses) via the local gateway 192.168.1.1 that can be reached on device eth0 `$ ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0`

## Configure a hostname for some other system on your network
You can configure your Linux (or macOS) system in order to tie in an identifier `<hostname>` to some other system's IP address in your network. You can configure it:

+   Systemwide. You should modify the _/etc/hosts_ file. You just have to add to that file a new line containing:
    1.  the remote system's IP address `<ip_rem>`,
    2.  one or more blank spaces, and
    3.  the identifier `<hostname>`.

+   For a single user. You should modify the _~/.hosts_ file --- you-d have to create it. It is not as simple as for systemwide. [Here][hostname-s-user] you can see an explanation. 

[hostname-s-user]: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/10438/can-i-create-a-user-specific-hosts-file-to-complement-etc-hosts

---

For instance, you could add this line using the [`cat`][cat-add-line] Unix tool. Suppose that you want to make a `ping` to a PC in yout local network whose IP address is 192.168.1.44 and you want to refer to that IP address just by `remote_pc`. Then you must write on your shell:

[cat-add-line]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix)

```
$ sudo cat 192.168.1.44 remote_pc
```

Then you can make that ping just by:

```
$ ping remote_pc
```
