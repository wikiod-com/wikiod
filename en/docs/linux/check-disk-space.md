## Checking Disk Space
It's quite common to want to check the status of the various partitions/drives on your server/computer to see how full they are. The following command is the one you'll want to run:

    df -h

This will produce output similar to the following:

    [root@mail ~]# df -h
    Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/mapper/VolGroup-lv_root
                           19G  1.6G   16G   9% /
    tmpfs                 245M     0  245M   0% /dev/shm
    /dev/sda1             485M   47M  413M  11% /boot

In this basic example, we can see that the `/` partition only has `9%` used.

For a more complex example that also covers using `df` to see various mountpoints, see below:

    [root@mail ~]# df -h
    Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/mapper/VG-root   1.9T  1.7T   89G  95% /
    /dev/mapper/VG-var    431G  145G  264G  36% /var
    devtmpfs              7.8G  204K  7.8G   1% /dev
    tmpfs                 7.8G  4.0K  7.8G   1% /dev/shm
    /dev/md1              495M  126M  344M  27% /boot
    ku.example.com:9421   2.5T  487G  2.0T  20% /mnt/test
    tmpfs                 500M   86M  415M  18% /var/ngx_pagespeed_cache

In this example, we have a `/` partition that's `95%` full along with an additional `/var` partition that's only `36%` full.

It's got an external network mount of `2T` that's mounted on `/mnt/test` and a ramdisk/tmpfs mount of 500M mounted on `/var/ngx_pagespeed_cache`.


## Investigate Directories For Disk Usage
Sometimes it may be required to find out which directory consuming how much disk space especially when you are used `df -h` and realized your available disk space is low. 

**du:**

`du` command summarizes disk usage of the set of FILEs, recursively for directories.

It's often uses with `-sh` option:

    -s, --summarize
                  display only a total for each argument
    -h, --human-readable
                  print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

For summarizing disk usages of the files in the current directory we use:

    du -sh *

Example output:

    572K    Documents
    208M    Downloads
    4,0K    Music
    724K    Pictures
    4,0K    Public
    4,0K    Templates
    4,0K    Videos


We can also include hidden files with using:

    du -sh .[!.]* *

Example output:

    6,3M    .atom
    4,0K    .bash_history
    4,0K    .bash_logout
    8,0K    .bashrc
    350M    .cache
    195M    .config
    12K    .dbus
    4,0K    .dmrc
    44K    .gconf
    60K    .gem
    520K    .gimp-2.8
    28K    .gnome
    4,0K    .ICEauthority
    8,3M    .local
    8,0K    .nano
    404K    .nv
    36K    .pki
    4,0K    .profile
    8,0K    .ssh
    0    .sudo_as_admin_successful
    4,0K    .Xauthority
    4,0K    .xsession-errors
    4,0K    .xsession-errors.old
    572K    Documents
    208M    Downloads
    4,0K    Music
    724K    Pictures
    4,0K    Public
    4,0K    Templates
    4,0K    Videos

Thirdly, you can add total to the output by adding ,-c, option:

    du -sch .[!.]* *

Result:

    .
    .
    .
    4,0K    Templates
    4,0K    Videos
    769M    total

**Most importantly** using `du` command properly on the root directory is a life saving action to find out what application/service or user is consuming your disk space wildly. For example, in case of a ridiculously low level of disk space availability for a web and mail server, the reason could be a spam attack to your mail service and you can diagnose it just by using `du` command.

Investigate root directory for disk usage:

    sudo du -sch /.[!.]* /*

Example output:

    16K    /.VolumeIcon.icns
    24K    /.VolumeIcon.png
    13M    /bin
    57M    /boot
    4,0K    /cdrom
    620K    /dev
    13M    /etc
    779M    /home
    0    /initrd.img
    406M    /lib
    3,9M    /lib32
    4,0K    /lib64
    16K    /lost+found
    4,0K    /media
    4,0K    /mnt
    367M    /opt
    du: cannot access '/proc/18221/task/18221/fd/4': No such file or directory
    du: cannot access '/proc/18221/task/18221/fdinfo/4': No such file or directory
    du: cannot access '/proc/18221/fd/4': No such file or directory
    du: cannot access '/proc/18221/fdinfo/4': No such file or directory
    0    /proc
    20K    /root
    du: cannot access '/run/user/1000/gvfs': Permission denied
    9,4M    /run
    13M    /sbin
    4,0K    /srv
    0    /sys
    72K    /tmp
    3,5G    /usr
    639M    /var
    0    /vmlinuz
    5,8G    total

Lastly, the best method forms when you add a threshold size value for directories to ignore small ones. This command will only show folders with more than 1GB in size which located under root directory up to the farthermost branch of the whole directory tree in your file system:

    sudo du --threshold=1G -ch /.[!.]* /*

Example output:

    1,4G    /usr/lib
    1,8G    /usr/share
    3,5G    /usr
    5,8G    total
