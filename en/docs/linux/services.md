## List running service on Ubuntu

To get a list of the service on your system, you may run:

    service --status-all

The output of `service --status-all` lists the state of services controlled by `System V`.

The `+` indicates the service is running, `-` indicates a stopped service. You can see this by running service SERVICENAME status for a + and - service.

Some services are managed by **Upstart**. You can check the status of all Upstart services with sudo initctl list. Any service managed by Upstart will also show in the list provided by service --status-all but will be marked with a ?.

## Systemd service management
## Listing services ##
 - `systemctl` To list running services
 - `systemctl --failed` To list failed services

## Managing Targets (Similar to Runlevels in SysV) ##
 - `systemctl get-default` To find the default target for your system
 - `systemctl set-default <target-name>` To set the default target for your system

## Managing services at runtime ##
  - `systemctl start [service-name]` To start a service
  - `systemctl stop [service-name]` To stop a service
  - `systemctl restart [service-name]` To restart a service
  - `systemctl reload [service-name]` To request service to reload its configuration
  - `systemctl status [service-name]` To show current status of a service

## Managing autostart of services ##
  - `systemctl is-enabled [service-name]` To show whether a service is enabled on system boot
  - `systemctl is-active [service-name]` To show whether a service is currently active(running)
  - `systemctl enable [service-name]` To enable a service on system boot
  - `systemctl disable [service-name]` To disable a service on system boot

## Masking services ##
  - `systemctl mask [service-name]` To mask a service (Makes it hard to start a service by mistake)
  - `systemctl unmask [service-name]` To unmask a service

## Restarting systemd ##
`systemctl daemon-reload`
