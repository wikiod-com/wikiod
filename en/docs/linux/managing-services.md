Some systems with systemd, such as Ubuntu, still allow the use of the `service <name> [start|stop|status]` command, redirecting it to `systemctl [start|stop|status] <name>`.

## Diagnosing a problem with a service
On systems using systemd, such as Fedora => 15, Ubuntu (Server and Desktop) >= 15.04, and RHEL/CentOS >= 7:

`systemctl status [servicename]`

...where `[servicename]` is the service in question; for example, `systemctl status sshd`.

This will show basic status information and any recent errors logged.

You can see further errors with `journalctl`. For example,`journalctl -xe` will load the last 1000 logged into a pager (like `less`), jumping to the end. You can also use `journalctl -f`, which will follow log messages as they come in.

To see logs for a particular service, use the `-t` flag, like this:

    journalctl -f -t sshd

Other handy options include `-p` for priority (`-p warnings` to see only warnings and above), `-b` for "since last boot", and `-S` for "since" â€” putting that together, we might do

    journalctl -p err -S yesterday

to see all items logged as errors since yesterday.


If journalctl is not available, or if you are following application error logs which do not use the system journal, the `tail` command can be used to show the last few lines of a file. A useful flag for tail is `-f` (for "follow"), which causes tail continue showing data as it gets appended to the file. To see messages from most services on the system:

`tail -f /var/log/messages`

Or, if the service is privileged, and may log sensitive data:

`tail -f /var/log/secure`

Some services have their own log files, a good example is `auditd`, the linux auditing daemon, which has its logs stored in `/var/log/audit/`. If you do not see output from your service in `/var/log/messages` try looking for service specific logs in `/var/log/`



## Starting and Stopping Services
On systems that use the System-V style init scripts, such as RHEL/CentOS 6:
    
`service <service> start`

`service <service> stop`

On systems using systemd, such as Ubuntu (Server and Desktop) >= 15.04, and RHEL/CentOS >= 7:

`systemctl <service> dnsmasq`

`systemctl <service> dnsmasq`



## Getting the status of a service
On systems that use the System-V style init scripts, such as RHEL/CentOS 6: 
    
`service <service> status`

On systems using systemd, such as Ubuntu (Server and Desktop) >= 15.04, and RHEL/CentOS >= 7.0:

`systemctl status <service>`
