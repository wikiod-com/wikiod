Collection of commands to fetch system related information.

## Statistics about CPU, Memory, Network and Disk (I/O operations)
To get general statistics about main components of Linux family of `stat` commands are extremely useful 

# CPU

To get processors related statistics you can use `mpstat` command but with some options it will provide better visibility: 

    $ mpstat 2 10

# Memory 

We all know command `free` to show amount of (remaining) RAM but to see all statistic including I/O operations: 

    $ vmstat 2 10

# Disk 

To get general information about your disk operations in real time you can utilise `iostat`.  

    $ iostat -kx 2

# Network 

To be able to see what is happening with your network services you can use `netstat` 

    $ netstat -ntlp # open TCP sockets 
    $ netstat -nulp # open UDP sockets 
    $ netstat -nxlp # open Unix sockets 

But you can find useful monitoring to see network traffic in real time: 

    $ sudo iftop

# Optional 

To generate statistics in real time related to I/O operations across all components you can use `dstat`. That tool that is a versatile replacement for `vmstat`, `iostat` and `ifstat`




## List Hardware
**Ubuntu:**

 **lshw** is a small tool to extract detailed information on the hardware configuration of the machine. It can report exact memory configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration,  CPU version and speed, cache configuration, bus speed, etc.

    $ sudo lshw | less (or more)
    $ sudo lshw -html > myhardware.html
    $ sudo lshw -xml > myhardware.xml

To show PCI info

    $ lspci -tv

To see USB info 

    $ lsusb -tv

To display BIOS informations 

    $ dmidecode -q | less

To see specific information about disk (disk sda in example) you can use: 

    $ hdparm -i /dev/sda

Few additional utilities/commands will help gather some extra information: 

    $ smartctl -A /dev/sda | grep Power_On_Hours # How long has this disk (system) been powered on in total
    $ hdparm -tT /dev/sda # Do a read speed test on disk sda
    $ badblocks -s /dev/sda # Test for unreadable blocks on disk sda

## Find CPU model/speed information
**Ubuntu:**

    $ cat /proc/cpuinfo

## Process monitoring and information gathering
Overall you have two ways to monitor processes at linux host

# Static monitoring 

Most widely used command is `ps` (i.e., process status) command is used to provide information about the currently running processes, including their process identification numbers (PIDs).

Here few useful options to gather specific informations.

List processes in a hierarchy

    $ ps -e -o pid,args --forest

List processes sorted by % cpu usage

    $ ps -e -o pcpu,cpu,nice,state,cputime,args --sort pcpu | sed '/^ 0.0 /d'

List processes sorted by mem (KB) usage.

    $ ps -e -orss=,args= | sort -b -k1,1n | pr -TW$COLUMNS

List all threads for a particular process ("firefox-bin" process in example )

    $ ps -C firefox-bin -L -o pid,tid,pcpu,state

After finding specific process you can gather information related to it using `lsof` to list paths that process id has open

    $ lsof -p $$ 

Or based on path find out list processes that have specified path open

    $ lsof ~


# Interactive monitoring 

Most commonly known tool for dynamic monitoring is: 

    $ top

That mostly default command that have huge amount options to filter and represent information in real time (in comparison to `ps` command. 

Still there are more advance options that can be considered and installed as `top` replacement

    $ htop -d 5

or 
 
    $ atop 

Which has ability to log all the activities into log file (default atop will log all the activity on every 600 seconds) 
To this list there are few specialised commands as `iotop` or `iftop`

    $ sudo iotop



## Using tools like lscpu and lshw
By using tools like lscpu as lscpu is an easy way to get CPU information.

    $ lscpu

    CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit
    Byte Order:            Little Endian
    CPU(s):                4

    Core(s) per socket:    4
    Socket(s):             1
    NUMA node(s):          1

    L2 cache:              2048K
    NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-3

By using tool lshw

    $ lshw | grep cpu
