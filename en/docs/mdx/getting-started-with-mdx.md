## Installation or Setup
Similar to SQL for doing your first steps in MDX you need to start by installing a Server. 

There are several servers available that are compatible with MDX (check [wikipedia page][1]) with a couple of them free or with a community edition. 

Once you've your server you'll have to create your schema, you might as well use a demo or default schema available. Creating a schema is a vendor specific task, so you'll have to follow the documentation of each vendor.
