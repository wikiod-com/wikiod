## Syntax
- random(max) //Returns a (long) pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and max (exclusive)

- random(min, max) //Returns a (long) pseudo-random number between min (inclusive) and max (exclusive)

- randomSeed(seed) //Initializes de pseudo-random number generator, causing it to start at a specified point in its sequence.

## Parameters
| Parameter| Details|
| ------ | ------ |
| min| The minimum possible value (inclusive) to be generated by the `random()` function.|
| max| The maximum possible value (exclusive) to be generated by the `random()` function.|
| seed| The seed that will be used to shuffle the `random()` function.|

If `randomSeed()` is called with a fixed value (eg. `randomSeed(5)`), the sequence of random numbers generated by the sketch will repeat each time it is run. In most cases, a random seed is preferred, which can be obtained by reading an unconnected analog pin.

## Generate a random number
The `random()` function can be used to generate pseudo-random numbers:

<!-- language: lang-cpp -->

    void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
    }
    
    void loop() {
        long randomNumber = random(500);  // Generate a random number between 0 and 499
        Serial.println(randomNumber);

        randomNumber = random(100, 1000); // Generate a random number between 100 and 999
        Serial.println(randomNumber);

        delay(100);
    }

## Setting a seed
If it is important for a sequence of numbers generated by `random()` to differ, it is a good idea to specify a seed with `randomSeed()`:

<!-- language: lang-cpp -->

    void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
        
        // If analog pin 0 is left unconnected, analogRead(0) will produce a
        // different random number each time the sketch is run.
        randomSeed(analogRead(0));
    }
    
    void loop() {
        long randomNumber = random(500); // Generate a random number between 0 and 499
        Serial.println(randomNumber);
    
        delay(100);
    }
