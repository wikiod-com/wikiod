<!-- This section provides an overview of what parsing is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within parsing, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for parsing is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics. -->

Parsing, in common usage, refers to analysing a piece of language, such as a sentence, and using the grammar rules of that language to identify the components pieces and thus learn the meaning. In computer science it refers to a specific algorithmic process of recognising the sequence of symbols as a valid one, and permit the meaning (or *semantics*) of a language construct to be determined, often in a computer language compiler or interpreter.
