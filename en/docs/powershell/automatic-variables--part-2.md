Topic "Automatic Variables" already has 7 examples listed and we can't add more.  This topic will have a continuation of Automatic Variables. 

Automatic Variables are variables that store state information for PowerShell. These variables are created and maintained by Windows PowerShell.

Not sure if this is the best way to handle documenting Automatic Variables, yet this is better than nothing.  Please comment if you find a better way :)

## $PSVersionTable
Contains a read-only hash table (Constant, AllScope) that displays details about the version of PowerShell that is running in the current session.

    $PSVersionTable    #this call results in this:
    Name                           Value
    ----                           -----
    PSVersion                      5.0.10586.117
    PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}
    BuildVersion                   10.0.10586.117
    CLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000
    WSManStackVersion              3.0
    PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3
    SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1

The fastest way to get a version of PowerShell running:

    $PSVersionTable.PSVersion  
    # result :
    Major  Minor  Build  Revision
