**Windows PowerShell** is a shell and scripting component of the Windows Management Framework, an automation/configuration management framework from Microsoft built on the .NET Framework. PowerShell is installed by default on all supported versions of Windows client and server operating systems since Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2. Powershell can be updated at any time by downloading a later version of the [Windows Management Framework][1] (WMF). The "Alpha" version of PowerShell 6 is cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and OS X) and needs to be downloaded and installed from [this release page][2].
