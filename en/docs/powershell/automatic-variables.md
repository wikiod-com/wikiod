Automatic Variables are created and maintained by Windows PowerShell. One has the ability to call a variable just about any name in the book; The only exceptions to this are the variables that are already being managed by PowerShell. These variables, without a doubt, will be the most repetitious objects you use in PowerShell next to functions (like **$?** - indicates Success/ Failure status of the last operation)

## Syntax
 - `$$` - Contains the last token in the last line received by the session.
 - `$^` - Contains the first token in the last line received by the session.
 - `$?` - Contains the execution status of the last operation.
 - `$_` - Contains the current object in the pipeline

## $OFS
Variable called Output Field Separator contains string value that is used when converting an array to a string. By default `$OFS = " "` (*a space*), but it can be changed:

    PS C:\> $array = 1,2,3
    PS C:\> "$array" # default OFS will be used
    1 2 3
    PS C:\> $OFS = ",." # we change OFS to comma and dot
    PS C:\> "$array"
    1,.2,.3

    

## $?
Contains status of the last operation. When there is no error, it is set to `True`:

    PS C:\> Write-Host "Hello"
    Hello
    PS C:\> $?
    True

If there is some error, it is set to `False`:
    
    PS C:\> wrt-host
    wrt-host : The term 'wrt-host' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
    Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
    At line:1 char:1
    + wrt-host
    + ~~~~~~~~
        + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (wrt-host:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
    
    PS C:\> $?
    False

## $null
`$null` is used to represent absent or undefined value.  
`$null` can be used as an empty placeholder for empty value in arrays:

    PS C:\> $array = 1, "string", $null
    PS C:\> $array.Count
    3

When we use the same array as the source for `ForEach-Object`, it will process all three items (including $null):

    PS C:\> $array | ForEach-Object {"Hello"}
    Hello
    Hello
    Hello

Be careful! This means that `ForEach-Object` **WILL** process even `$null` all by itself:

    PS C:\> $null | ForEach-Object {"Hello"} # THIS WILL DO ONE ITERATION !!!
    Hello

Which is very unexpected result if you compare it to classic `foreach` loop:
    
    PS C:\> foreach($i in $null) {"Hello"} # THIS WILL DO NO ITERATION
    PS C:\>


## $error
Array of most recent error objects. The first one in the array is the most recent one:

    PS C:\> throw "Error" # resulting output will be in red font
    Error
    At line:1 char:1
    + throw "Error"
    + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        + CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (Error:String) [], RuntimeException
        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Error

    PS C:\> $error[0] # resulting output will be normal string (not red    )
    Error
    At line:1 char:1
    + throw "Error"
    + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        + CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (Error:String) [], RuntimeException
        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Error


Usage hints: When using the `$error` variable in a format cmdlet (e.g. format-list), be aware to use the `-Force` switch. Otherwise the format cmdlet is going to output the `$error`contents in above shown manner.

Error entries can be removed via e.g. `$Error.Remove($Error[0])`. 


## $pid
Contains process ID of the current hosting process.

    PS C:\> $pid
    26080

## Boolean values
`$true` and `$false` are two variables that represent logical TRUE and FALSE.

Note that you have to specify the dollar sign as the first character (which is different from C#).

    $boolExpr = "abc".Length -eq 3 # length of "abc" is 3, hence $boolExpr will be True
    if($boolExpr -eq $true){
        "Length is 3"
    }
    # result will be "Length is 3" 
    $boolExpr -ne $true
    #result will be False

Notice that when you use boolean true/false in your code you write `$true` or `$false`, but when Powershell returns a boolean, it looks like `True` or `False`

## $_ / $PSItem
Contains the object/item currently being processed by the pipeline.
    
    PS C:\> 1..5 | % { Write-Host "The current item is $_" }
    The current item is 1
    The current item is 2
    The current item is 3
    The current item is 4
    The current item is 5

`$PSItem` and `$_` are identical and can be used interchangeably, but `$_` is by far the most commonly used.
