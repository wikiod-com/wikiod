This topic is to briefly describe how C# or VB .NET Managed code can be scripted and utilised within a PowerShell script. This topic is not exploring all facets of the Add-Type cmdlet.

For more information on the Add-Type cmdlet, please refer to the MSDN documentation (for 5.1) here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.utility/add-type

## Parameters
| Parameter    | Details |  
| ------------ | ------- |  
| -TypeDefinition<String_> | Accepts the code as a string |  
| -Language<String_> | Specifies the Managed Code language.Accepted values: CSharp, CSharpVersion3, CSharpVersion2, VisualBasic, JScript  |  


Removing Added types
--------------------

In later versions of PowerShell, Remove-TypeData has been added to the PowerShell cmdlet libraries which can allow for removal of a type within a session. For more details on this cmdlet, go here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/4.0/microsoft.powershell.utility/remove-typedata

CSharp and .NET syntax
----------------------

For those experience with .NET it goes without saying that the differing versions of C# can be quite radically different in their level of support for certain syntax.

If utilising Powershell 1.0 and/or -Language CSharp, the managed code will be utilising .NET 2.0 which is lacking in a number of features which C# developers typically use without a second thought these days, such as Generics, Linq and Lambda. On top of this is formal polymorphism, which is handled with defaulted parameters in later versions of C#/.NET.

## C# Example
This example shows how to embed some basic C# into a PowerShell script, add it to the runspace/session and utilise the code within PowerShell syntax.

    $code = "
    using System;

    namespace MyNameSpace
    {
        public class Responder
        {
            public static void StaticRespond()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Static Response");
            }

            public void Respond()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Instance Respond");
            }
        }
    }
    "@

    # Check the type has not been previously added within the session, otherwise an exception is raised
    if (-not ([System.Management.Automation.PSTypeName]'MyNameSpace.Responder').Type)
    {
        Add-Type -TypeDefinition $code -Language CSharp;
    }
    
    [MyNameSpace.Responder]::StaticRespond();

    $instance = New-Object MyNameSpace.Responder;
    $instance.Respond();

## VB.NET Example
This example shows how to embed some basic C# into a PowerShell script, add it to the runspace/session and utilise the code within PowerShell syntax.

    $code = @"
    Imports System

    Namespace MyNameSpace
        Public Class Responder
            Public Shared Sub StaticRespond()
                Console.WriteLine("Static Response")
            End Sub

            Public Sub Respond()
                Console.WriteLine("Instance Respond")
            End Sub
        End Class
    End Namespace
    "@

    # Check the type has not been previously added within the session, otherwise an exception is raised
    if (-not ([System.Management.Automation.PSTypeName]'MyNameSpace.Responder').Type)
    {
        Add-Type -TypeDefinition $code -Language VisualBasic;
    }
    
    [MyNameSpace.Responder]::StaticRespond();

    $instance = New-Object MyNameSpace.Responder;
    $instance.Respond();
