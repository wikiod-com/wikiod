Dropwizard pulls together **stable, mature libraries** from the Java ecosystem into a **simple, light-weight** package that lets you focus on getting things done.

Dropwizard has out-of-the-box support for sophisticated **configuration, application metrics, logging, operational tools**, and much more, allowing you and your team to ship a production-quality web service in the shortest time possible.

It uses:

 - [Jetty][1] for HTTP
 - [Jersey][2] for REST
 - [Jackson][3] for JSON
 - [Metrics][4] for metrics
