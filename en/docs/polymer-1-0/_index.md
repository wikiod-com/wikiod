 - The example above shows bare minimum structure of a custom(Polymer)
   element using local dom.
 - A Polymer element can also be created entirely using `script` tag, but that is not part of this topic.
 - Even though `style` tag is not a part of bare minimum structure it has been kept there just for understanding purpose.
 - Also, script tag can be used in both imperative and declarative fashion i.e user can have a separate `js` file with atleast above written code and then refer it in element.
 - Please note that `id` of `dom-module` and `is` property of `Polymer constructor` should always be same.
