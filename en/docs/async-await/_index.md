`async-await` allows asynchronous (means non-blocking, parallel) execution of code. It helps to keep your UI responsive at all times, while running potentially long operations in the background.

It is especially useful for I/O operations (like downloading from a server, or reading a file from the HDD), but it can also be used to execute CPU intensive calculations without freezing your application.
