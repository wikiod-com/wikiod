jQuery is a JavaScript library which simplifies DOM operations, event handling, AJAX, and animations. It also takes care of many browser compatibility issues in underlying DOM and javascript engines.

Each version of jQuery can be downloaded from https://code.jquery.com/jquery/ in both compressed (minified) and uncompressed formats.
