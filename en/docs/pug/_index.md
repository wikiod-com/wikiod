Pug is a high performance, robust, elegant, feature rich template engine. It was influenced by [Haml](http://haml.info/) and implemented with JavaScript for Node.js and browsers. Implementations exists for Laravel, PHP Scala, Ruby, Python and Java.

It features:
* [Express integration](https://pugjs.org/api/express.html)
* [Conditionals](https://pugjs.org/language/conditionals.html)
* [Filters](https://pugjs.org/language/filters.html)
* [Includes](https://pugjs.org/language/includes.html)
* [Inheritance](https://pugjs.org/language/inheritance.html)
* [Interpolation](https://pugjs.org/language/interpolation.html)
* [Iteration](https://pugjs.org/language/iteration.html)
* [Mixins](https://pugjs.org/language/mixins.html)

Pug was previously known under the *Jade* name but has been renamed because of a registered trademark case.

This remark section should also mention any large subjects within pug, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for pug is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
