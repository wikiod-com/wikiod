This section provides an overview of what log4j2 is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within log4j2, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for log4j2 is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.

**Why not Log4j 1.x?**

Log4j 1.x is end-of-life as of August 5, 2015. [1][2].  Apache Log4j 2 is the successor to Log4j 1.x; provides bindings for projects that depend on Log4j 1.x, but wish to upgrade to Log4j 2.  In addition to compatibility with Log4j 1.x, compatibility is provided for the SLF4J, Commons Logging, and java.util.logging APIs.
