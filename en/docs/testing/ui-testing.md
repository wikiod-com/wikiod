The focus of this topic is basically cover most important aspects of UI testing. This post would be mostly beneficial for freshers since they get assignments to work on and many times it so happens that few of the important points are missed.
Let's help the freshers by contributing to this topic :)

## [UI Testing] How to test a website?
Following points are to be kept in mind always:

 1. Take the PRD (Product Requirement Document from Business Analyst/Project Manager). If they don't have it, insist on a documentation since that will be the bible for your testing
 2. Once you get it, make sure to read it thoroughly.
 3. You will get complete idea about what the system actually does and how the UI should be, in different cases.
 4. Make sure to take into consideration the different OS / Browsers combos on which the system is expected to be tested. Ask PM or client (if needed) for this part, but let's be very clear about this in the early phase itself.
 5. Once you are clear with the OS/Browser combinations, make sure you have it in your workplace. If not, start with procuring those combos.
 6. Make sure the link is accessible and the code is deployed on appropriate environment (staging, pre-staging etc.)
 7. Hit the link on the required browsers on required environements
 8. Observe the speed at which the site loads on each OS/browser combo and make a note
 9. Observe the images/text loaded correctly or not. Also make sure to have the correct font in place for all the browsers.
 10. Explore through all the pages and make sure each and every thing is at its place. No distortion in UI should be observed.
 11. (If the website is responsive (mobile friendly), make sure that it loads accurately when you resize the browser window or check it on larger screen resolutions.
 12. (Partial functional testing) Make sure that all the buttons/links are clickable and are redirecting to the correct pages.
 13. Also observe the functionality of the system as per the UI developed.
