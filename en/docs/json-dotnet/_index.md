[Json.NET][1] is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET. It's a **.Net** Assembly that exposes a wide variety of classes and methods to help perform common tasks with json data. 

This includes the ability to do things like serializing json data into class instances, data files as well as deserializing json data that might be coming from many different sources like from an API end point or from `.json` data files.
