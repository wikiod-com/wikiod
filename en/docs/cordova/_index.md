Apache Cordova is used to create Mobile apps with HTML, CSS & JS. 

Apache Cordova targets multiple platforms with one code base.

Apache Cordova is Free and open source.

***Cordova wraps your HTML/JavaScript app into a native container which can access the device functions of several platforms. These functions are exposed via a unified JavaScript API, allowing you to easily write one set of code to target nearly every phone or tablet on the market today and publish to their app stores.***

> Who could use Apache Cordova

 1. a mobile developer and want to extend an application across more
    than one platform, without having to re-implement it with each
    platform's language and tool set.

 2. a web developer and want to deploy a web app that's packaged for
    distribution in various app store portals.

 3. a mobile developer interested in mixing native application
    components with a WebView (special browser window) that can access
    device-level APIs, or if you want to develop a plugin interface
    between native and WebView components.
