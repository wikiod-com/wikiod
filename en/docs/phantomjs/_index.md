PhantomJS is a headless Selenium WebDriver with JavaScript support.

It is based on WebKit, making it behave similarly to Google Chrome or Safari.

It is slightly faster than a regular WebDriver like ChromeDriver or FirefoxDriver in both startup time and performance.

PhantomJS has many [options and services][1] that alter the behavior of the test, such as hiding the command prompt or not loading images.
