As described by its [official Start Guide](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/):
> Maven is an attempt to apply **patterns** to a project's build infrastructure in order to promote comprehension and productivity by providing a clear path in the use of **best practices**.

Maven is essentially a project management and comprehension tool and as such provides a way to help with managing:

 - Builds
 - Documentation
 - Reporting
 - Dependencies
 - Version Control
 - Releases
 - Distribution

Hence, supporting developers across many phases of the whole Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

This philosophy is part of Maven in its core: i.e., the word *maven* means *accumulator of knowledge* (in Yiddish).

Maven is about the application of **patterns** in order to achieve an infrastructure which displays the characteristics of visibility, reusability, maintainability, and comprehensibility.  
- Maven was born of the very practical desire to make several projects work in the same way, as stated by the official [Maven philosophy](https://maven.apache.org/background/philosophy-of-maven.html) statement.
- Developers could freely move between projects, knowing clearly how they all worked by understanding how one of them worked
- The same idea extends to testing, generating documentation, generating metrics and reports, and deploying
