JSP is a **Java view technology** running on a server which allows you to write template text in client side languages like [HTML][1], [CSS][2], [JavaScript][3] and so on. JSP supports the so-called [*taglibs*][4] which are backed by pieces of Java code with which you can control the page flow and/or output dynamically (programmatically). A well known taglib is [JSTL][5]. JSP also supports [Expression Language][6] ([EL][7]), with syntax like `${}` which can be used to access backend data (actually, the attributes which are available in page, request, session and application scopes), mostly in combination with taglibs.
