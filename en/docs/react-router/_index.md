React Router is a popular and complete routing library for React.js that keeps UI in sync with the URL. It supports lazy code loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling, and was initially inspired by Ember's router.

TODO: this section should also mention any large subjects within react-router, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for react-router is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
