Eclipse has many shortcuts to make your life easier.

## Comment/Uncomment code
To comment or uncomment code select the lines and use **Ctrl + Shift + C** or **Ctrl + Shift + /** 

## Refactor Highlighted Text
Renaming a variable or class is usually a tedious task, by searching for all the locations where it is used. This can be significantly speeded up by highlighting the word, pressing **Alt+Shift+R** and then typing the new word. Eclipse will automatically rename the word in every file where it is called.

## Format xml
When you add entries to an xml or copy from other sources, there often tends to be uneven tabs and spaces around the entries.

When you press **Ctrl + Shift + F**, you easily align the entire document and remove the extra tabs as well. Thus the text gets formatted and eventually becomes readable.

## Open Resouce Dialog
To access the Open Resource dialog use **Ctrl + Shift + R**. 
From here you can start typing a resource name and it will find all matches in the workspace, this makes it easier to find a file when you don't know exactly were it is. 

## To get a println
If you want System.out.println(); but don't want to type the whole thing out you can just type **syso** and hit **Ctrl + Spacebar**. It will type the rest and set the cursor between the parenthesis. 

## Generate Getters and Setters
Eclipse can generate basic getters and setters for you. Right click in you class file and go to **Source - Generate Getters and Setters** (ALT+SHIFT+S). This will open a dialog where you can choose which fields you would like to have getters and setters generated for.
