One of MEF's big advantages over other technologies that support the inversion-of-control pattern is that it supports resolving dependencies that are not known at design-time, without needing much (if any) configuration.

All examples require a reference to the System.ComponentModel.Composition assembly.

Also, all the (Basic) examples use these as their sample business objects:

    using System.Collections.ObjectModel;

    namespace Demo
    {
        public sealed class User
        {
            public User(int id, string name)
            {
                this.Id = id;
                this.Name = name;
            }

            public int Id { get; }
            public string Name { get; }
            public override string ToString() => $"User[Id: {this.Id}, Name={this.Name}]";
        }

        public interface IUserProvider
        {
            ReadOnlyCollection<User> GetAllUsers();
        }
    }

## Connecting (Basic)
See the other (Basic) examples above.

    using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
    using System.ComponentModel.Composition.Hosting;

    namespace Demo
    {
        public static class Program
        {
            public static void Main()
            {
                using (var catalog = new ApplicationCatalog())
                using (var exportProvider = new CatalogExportProvider(catalog))
                using (var container = new CompositionContainer(exportProvider))
                {
                    exportProvider.SourceProvider = container;

                    UserWriter writer = new UserWriter();

                    // at this point, writer's userProvider field is null
                    container.ComposeParts(writer);

                    // now, it should be non-null (or an exception will be thrown).
                    writer.PrintAllUsers();
                }
            }
        }
    }

As long as something in the application's assembly search path has `[Export(typeof(IUserProvider))]`, `UserWriter`'s corresponding import will be satisfied and the users will be printed.

Other types of catalogs (e.g., `DirectoryCatalog`) can be used instead of (or in addition to) `ApplicationCatalog`, to look in other places for exports that satisfy the imports.

## Exporting a Type (Basic)
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
    using System.ComponentModel.Composition;

    namespace Demo
    {
        [Export(typeof(IUserProvider))]
        public sealed class UserProvider : IUserProvider
        {
            public ReadOnlyCollection<User> GetAllUsers()
            {
                return new List<User>
                {
                    new User(0, "admin"),
                    new User(1, "Dennis"),
                    new User(2, "Samantha"),
                }.AsReadOnly();
            }
        }
    }

This could be defined virtually anywhere; all that matters is that the application knows where to look for it (via the ComposablePartCatalogs it creates).

## Importing (Basic)

    using System;
    using System.ComponentModel.Composition;

    namespace Demo
    {
        public sealed class UserWriter
        {
            [Import(typeof(IUserProvider))]
            private IUserProvider userProvider;

            public void PrintAllUsers()
            {
                foreach (User user in this.userProvider.GetAllUsers())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(user);
                }
            }
        }
    }

This is a type that has a dependency on an `IUserProvider`, which could be defined anywhere.  Like the previous example, all that matters is that the application knows where to look for the matching export (via the ComposablePartCatalogs it creates).
