A Synchronization Context is an abstraction that allows consuming to code to pass units of work to a scheduler, without requiring awareness of how the work will be scheduled. 

Synchronization contexts are traditionally used to ensure that code is run on a specific thread. In WPF and Winforms applications, a `SynchronizationContext` representing the UI thread is provided by the presentation framework. In this way `SynchronizationContext` can be thought of as a producer-consumer pattern for delegates. A worker thread will _produce_ executable code (the delegate) and queue it or _consumption_ by the UI message loop.

The Task Parallel Library provides features for automatically capturing and using synchronization contexts.

## Execute code on the UI thread after performing background work
This example shows how to update a UI component from a background thread by using a `SynchronizationContext`


    void Button_Click(object sender, EventArgs args)
    {
        SynchronizationContext context = SynchronizationContext.Current;
        Task.Run(() =>
        {
            for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
            {
                Thread.Sleep(500); //simulate work being done
                context.Post(ShowProgress, "Work complete on item " + i);
            }
        }
    }

    void UpdateCallback(object state)
    {
        // UI can be safely updated as this method is only called from the UI thread
        this.MyTextBox.Text = state as string;
    }

In this example, if you tried to directly update `MyTextBox.Text` inside the `for` loop, you would get a threading error. By posting the `UpdateCallback` action to the `SynchronizationContext`, the text box is updated on the same thread as the rest of the UI.

In practice, progress updates should be performed using an instance of `System.IProgress<T>`. The default implementation `System.Progress<T>` automatically captures the synchronisation context it is created on.
