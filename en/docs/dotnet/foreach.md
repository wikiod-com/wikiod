**Use it at all?**

You might argue that the intention of the .NET framework is that queries do not have any side effects and the `ForEach` method is by definition causing a side effect. You might find your code more maintainable and easier to test if you use a plain `foreach` instead.


## Extension method for IEnumerable
`ForEach()` is defined on the `List<T>` class, but not on `IQueryable<T>` or `IEnumerable<T>`. You have two choices in those cases:

**ToList first**

The enumeration (or query) will be evaluated, copying the results into a new list or calling the database. The method is then called on each item.
    
    IEnumerable<Customer> customers = new List<Customer>();
    
    customers.ToList().ForEach(c => c.SendEmail());
    
This method has obvious memory usage overhead, as an intermediate list is created.

**Extension method**

Write an extension method:

    public static void ForEach<T>(this IEnumerable<T> enumeration, Action<T> action)
    {
        foreach(T item in enumeration)
        {
            action(item);
        }
    }

Use:

    IEnumerable<Customer> customers = new List<Customer>();

    customers.ForEach(c => c.SendEmail());
    
Caution: The Framework's LINQ methods have been designed with the intention of being *pure*, which means they do not produce side effects. The `ForEach` method's only purpose is to produce side effects, and deviates from the other methods in this aspect. You may consider just using a plain `foreach` loop instead.

## Calling a method on an object in a list
    public class Customer {
       public void SendEmail()
       {
           // Sending email code here
       }
    }
    
    List<Customer> customers = new List<Customer>();
    
    customers.Add(new Customer());
    customers.Add(new Customer());

    customers.ForEach(c => c.SendEmail());
