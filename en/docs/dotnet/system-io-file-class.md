## Syntax
- string source;
- string destination;

## Parameters
| Parameter        | Details |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| `source`           | The file that is to be moved to another location. |
| `destination`      | The directory in which you would like to move `source` to (this variable should also contain the name (and file extension) of the file. |

## Delete a file
To delete a file (if you have required permissions) is as simple as:

    File.Delete(path);

However many things may go wrong:

* You do not have required permissions (`UnauthorizedAccessException` is thrown).
* File may be in use by someone else (`IOException` is thrown).
* File cannot be deleted because of low level error or media is read-only (`IOException` is thrown).
* File does not exist anymore (`IOException` is thrown).

Note that last point (file does not exist) is usually _circumvented_ with a code snippet like this:

    if (File.Exists(path))
        File.Delete(path);

However it's not an atomic operation and file may be delete by someone else between the call to `File.Exists()` and before `File.Delete()`. Right approach to handle I/O operation requires exception handling (assuming an alternative course of actions may be taken when operation fails):

    if (File.Exists(path))
    {
        try
        {
            File.Delete(path);
        }
        catch (IOException exception)
        {
            if (!File.Exists(path))
                return; // Someone else deleted this file
    
            // Something went wrong...
        }
        catch (UnauthorizedAccessException exception)
        {
            // I do not have required permissions
        }
    }

Note that this I/O errors sometimes are transitory (file in use, for example) and if a network connection is involved then it may automatically recover without any action from our side. It's then common to _retry_ an I/O operation few times with a small delay between each attempt:

    public static void Delete(string path)
    {
        if (!File.Exists(path))
            return;
    
        for (int i=1; ; ++i)
        {
            try
            {
                File.Delete(path);
                return;
            }
            catch (IOException e)
            {
                if (!File.Exists(path))
                    return;
    
                if (i == NumberOfAttempts)
                    throw;
    
                Thread.Sleep(DelayBetweenEachAttempt);
            }
    
            // You may handle UnauthorizedAccessException but this issue
            // will probably won't be fixed in few seconds...
        }
    }
    
    private const int NumberOfAttempts = 3;
    private const int DelayBetweenEachAttempt = 1000; // ms

Note: in Windows environment file will not be really deleted when you call this function, if someone else open the file using `FileShare.Delete` then file can be deleted but it will effectively happen only when owner will close the file.

## Strip unwanted lines from a text file
To change a text file is not easy because its content must be moved around. For _small_ files easiest method is to read its content in memory and then write back modified text.

In this example we read all lines from a file and drop all blank lines then we write back to original path:

    File.WriteAllLines(path,
        File.ReadAllLines(path).Where(x => !String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x)));

If file is too big to load it in memory and output path is different from input path:

    File.WriteAllLines(outputPath,
        File.ReadLines(inputPath).Where(x => !String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(x)));
    

## Convert text file encoding
Text is saved encoded (see also [Strings][1] topic) then sometimes you may need to change its encoding, this example assumes (for simplicity) that file is not too big and it can be entirely read in memory:

    public static void ConvertEncoding(string path, Encoding from, Encoding to)
    {
        File.WriteAllText(path, File.ReadAllText(path, from), to);
    }

When performing conversions do not forget that file may contain BOM (Byte Order Mark), to better understand how it's managed refer to [Encoding.UTF8.GetString doesn't take into account the Preamble/BOM][2].

## Enumerate files older than a specified amount
This snippet is an helper function to enumerate all files older than a specified age, it's useful - for example - when you have to delete old log files or old cached data.

    static IEnumerable<string> EnumerateAllFilesOlderThan(
                                   TimeSpan maximumAge,
                                   string path,
                                   string searchPattern = "*.*",
                                   SearchOption options = SearchOption.TopDirectoryOnly)
    {
        DateTime oldestWriteTime = DateTime.Now - maximumAge;

        return Directory.EnumerateFiles(path, searchPattern, options)
            .Where(x => Directory.GetLastWriteTime(x) < oldestWriteTime);
    }

Used like this:

    var oldFiles = EnumerateAllFilesOlderThan(TimeSpan.FromDays(7), @"c:\log", "*.log");

Few things to note:

* Search is performed using `Directory.EnumerateFiles()` instead of `Directory.GetFiles()`. Enumeration is _alive_ then you won't need to wait until all file system entries have been fetched.
* We're checking for last write time but you may use creation time or last access time (for example to delete _unused_ cached files, note that access time may be disabled).
* Granularity isn't uniform for all those properties (write time, access time, creation time), check MSDN for details about this.


## Move a File from one location to another
<h1>File.Move</h1>
In order to move a file from one location to another, one simple line of code can achieve this:

`File.Move(@"C:\TemporaryFile.txt", @"C:\TemporaryFiles\TemporaryFile.txt");`

However, there are many things that could go wrong with this simple operation. For instance, what if the user running your program does not have a Drive that is labelled 'C'? What if they did - but they decided to rename it to 'B', or 'M'?

What if the Source file (the file in which you would like to move) has been moved without your knowing - or what if it simply doesn't exist.

This can be circumvented by first checking to see whether the source file does exist:

    string source = @"C:\TemporaryFile.txt", destination = @"C:\TemporaryFiles\TemporaryFile.txt";
    if(File.Exists("C:\TemporaryFile.txt"))
    {
        File.Move(source, destination);
    }

This will ensure that at that very moment, the file does exist, and can be moved to another location. There may be times where a simple call to `File.Exists` won't be enough. If it isn't, check again, convey to the user that the operation failed - or handle the exception.

A `FileNotFoundException` is not the only exception you are likely to encounter.

See below for possible exceptions:

| Exception Type         | Description |
| ------                 | ------      |
| `IOException`          | The file already exists or the source file could not be found.
| `ArgumentNullException`| The value of the Source and/or Destination parameters is null. |
| `ArgumentException` | The value of the Source and/or Destination parameters are empty, or contain invalid characters. |
| `UnauthorizedAccessException` | You do not have the required permissions in order to perform this action. |
| `PathTooLongException` | The Source, Destination or specified path(s) exceed the maximum length. On Windows, a Path's length must be less than 248 characters, while File names must be less than 260 characters.
| `DirectoryNotFoundException` | The specified directory could not be found. |
| `NotSupportedException` | The Source or Destination paths or file names are in an invalid format.

## "Touch" a large amount of files (to update last write time)
This example updates last write time of a huge number of files (using `System.IO.Directory.EnumerateFiles` instead of `System.IO.Directory.GetFiles()`). Optionally you can specify a search pattern (default is `"*.*"` and eventually search through a directory tree (not only the specified directory):

    public static void Touch(string path,
                             string searchPattern = "*.*",
                             SearchOptions options = SearchOptions.None)
    {
        var now = DateTime.Now;
    
        foreach (var filePath in Directory.EnumerateFiles(path, searchPattern, options))
        {
            File.SetLastWriteTime(filePath, now);
        }
    }
