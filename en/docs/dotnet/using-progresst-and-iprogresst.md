## Simple Progress reporting
`IProgress<T>` can be used to report progress of some procedure to another procedure. This example shows how you can create a basic method that reports its progress.

    void Main()
    {
        IProgress<int> p = new Progress<int>(progress =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Running Step: {0}", progress);
        });
        LongJob(p);
    }
    
    public void LongJob(IProgress<int> progress)
    {
        var max = 10;
        for (int i = 0; i < max; i++)
        {
            progress.Report(i);
        }
    }

Output:

    Running Step: 0
    Running Step: 3
    Running Step: 4
    Running Step: 5
    Running Step: 6
    Running Step: 7
    Running Step: 8
    Running Step: 9
    Running Step: 2
    Running Step: 1

Note that when you this code runs, you may see numbers be output out of order. This is because the `IProgress<T>.Report()` method is run asynchronously, and is therefore not as suitable for situations where the progress must be reported in order. 

## Using IProgress<T>
It's important to note that the `System.Progress<T>` class does not have the `Report()` method available on it. This method was implemented explicitly from the `IProgress<T>` interface, and therefore must be called on a `Progress<T>` when it's cast to an `IProgress<T>`.

    var p1 = new Progress<int>();
    p1.Report(1); //compiler error, Progress does not contain method 'Report'

    IProgress<int> p2 = new Progress<int>();
    p2.Report(2); //works
    
    var p3 = new Progress<int>();
    ((IProgress<int>)p3).Report(3); //works
