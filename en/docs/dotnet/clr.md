## An introduction to Common Language Runtime
The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is a virtual machine environment and part of the .NET Framework. It contains:

 - A portable bytecode language called **Common Intermediate Language** (abbreviated CIL, or IL)
 - A Just-In-Time compiler that generates machine code
 - A tracing garbage collector that provides automatic memory management
 - Support for lightweight sub-processes called AppDomains 
 - Security mechanisms through the concepts of verifiable code and trust levels

Code that runs in the CLR is referred to as *managed code* to distinguish it from code running outside the CLR (usually native code) which is referred to as *unmanaged code*. There are various mechanisms that facilitate interoperability between managed and unmanaged code.
