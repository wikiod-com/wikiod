The .NET Framework is a set of libraries and a runtime, originally designed by Microsoft. All .NET programs compile to a bytecode called Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL). The MSIL is run by the Common Language Runtime (CLR).

Below you can find several examples of "Hello World" in various languages that support the .NET Framework. "Hello World" is a program that displays "Hello World" on the display device. It's used for illustrating the basic syntax for constructing a working program. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a language's compiler, development environment, and runtime environment are all working correctly.
