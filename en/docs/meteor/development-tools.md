## Integrated Development Environments
Development usually begins with an editor or an Integrated Development Environment.  The following IDEs are known to support Meteor to some extent:


- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Javascript IDE that can fully leverage Meteor's isomorphic javascript framework.  If you want to be able to hack on your editor itself, this is the one to choose.
- [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) - The newest Cloud Development offering that supports Meteor, with a tutorial.  
- [MeteorDevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meteor-devtools/ippapidnnboiophakmmhkdlchoccbgje) - Chrome extension for Blaze, DDP, and Minimongo.  
- [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - Light-weight and popular text editor.  
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - The most full featured IDE currently available for Meteor.  


## Debuggers
Most debugging happens in the terminal or in the Chrome or Safari develop tools, which are plenty sophisticated enough for 99% of your needs.  However, if you want to debug on Firefox or need extra server debugging functionality, there are a few extra utilities you can use.  

- [Firefox - Firebug](https://getfirebug.com/)    
- [Node-Inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) 
- [Meteor Toys][1] or add directly- `meteor add meteortoys:allthings`

## REST Clients
If you want to integrate Meteor with an external API, it's likely that it's going to exposed as a REST interface.  We tend to use the following Chrome apps for testing REST APIs.  

- [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/)    
- [DHC Rest Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dev-http-client/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm)
