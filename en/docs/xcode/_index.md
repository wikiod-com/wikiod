[**Xcode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) for macOS which supports the development of native apps for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Xcode is the successor to NeXT's [Project Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Builder) and PBX. (In fact, Xcode's project manifest files are still named with the `.pbxproj` extension.)

Xcode releases include stable versions of the [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) C/C++/Obj-C compiler, the [Swift](https://www.wikiod.com/swift/getting-started-with-swift-language) compiler, the [LLDB](http://lldb.llvm.org/) debugger, and iOS/watchOS/tvOS simulators. Xcode also includes [Interface Builder](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/), as well as tools for viewing and editing 3D models and scenes, image assets, and more.
