## Get localized product information from the App Store
Get localized product information from a set of product identifier strings using `SKProductsRequest`:

    import StoreKit

    let productIdentifierSet = Set(["yellowSubmarine", "pennyLane"])
    let productsRequest = SKProductsRequest(productIdentifiers: productIdentifierSet)

In order to process the products from the `productsRequest`, we need to assign a delegate to the request that handles the response. The delegate needs to conform to the `SKProductsRequestDelegate` protocol, which means that it must inherit from `NSObject` (i.e. any `Foundation` object) and implement the `productsRequest` method:

    class PaymentManager: NSObject, SKProductsRequestDelegate {

        var products: [SKProduct] = []

        func productsRequest(request: SKProductsRequest,
                             didReceiveResponse response: SKProductsResponse) {

            products = response.products

        }

    }

To initiate the `productsRequest` we assign `PaymentManager` as the products-request's delegate, and call the `start()` method on the request:

    let paymentManager = PaymentManager()
    productsRequest.delegate = paymentManager
    productsRequest.start()

If the requests succeeds the products will be in `paymentManager.products`.
