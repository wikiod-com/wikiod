## Intercepting calls from your app even from the background
From Apple documentation:

> Use the CTCallCenter class to obtain a list of current cellular calls, and to respond to state changes for calls such as from a dialing state to a connected state. Such state changes are known as cellular call events.

The purpose of CTCallCenter is to give the developer the opportunity to pause his app state during a call in order to give the user the best experience.

**Objective-C:**

First, we will define a new class member inside the class we want to handle the interceptions:

    @property (atomic, strong) CTCallCenter *callCenter;

Inside our class init (constructor) we will allocate new memory for our class member:

    [self setCallCenter:[CTCallCenter new]];

Afterwards, we will invoke our new method that actually handles the interceptions:

    - (void)registerPhoneCallListener
    {
    [[self callCenter] setCallEventHandler:^(CTCall * _Nonnull call) {
        NSLog(@"CallEventHandler called - interception in progress");

         if ([call.callState isEqualToString: CTCallStateConnected])
         {
             NSLog(@"Connected");
         }
         else if ([call.callState isEqualToString: CTCallStateDialing])
         {
             NSLog(@"Dialing");
         }
         else if ([call.callState isEqualToString: CTCallStateDisconnected])
         {
             NSLog(@"Disconnected");

         } else if ([call.callState isEqualToString: CTCallStateIncoming])
         {
             NSLog(@"Incomming");
         }
     }];
    }

That's it, if the user will use your app and will receive a phone call you could intercept this call and handle your app for a save state.

It is worth mentioning that there are 4 call states you can intercept:

    CTCallStateDialing
    CTCallStateIncoming
    CTCallStateConnected
    CTCallStateDisconnected

**Swift:**

Define your class member at the relevant class and define it:

        self.callCenter = CTCallCenter()
        self.callCenter.callEventHandler = { call in
            //  Handle your interception
            if call.callState == CTCallStateConnected
            {
            }
        }

__________________
What will happen if your app is in the background and you need to intercept calls while the app is in the background ?

For example, if you develop an **enterprise** app you can basically just add 2 capabilities (VOIP & Background fetch) in the Capabilities tab:

Your project target -> Capabilities -> Background Modes -> mark Voice over IP & Background fetch

## CallKit - ios 10
    //Header File
    
    <CallKit/CXCallObserver.h>
    
    CXCallObserver *callObserver = [[CXCallObserver alloc] init];
    
    // If queue is nil, then callbacks will be performed on main queue
    
    [callObserver setDelegate:self queue:nil];
    
    // Don't forget to store reference to callObserver, to prevent it from being released
    
    self.callObserver = callObserver;
    
    // get call status
    - (void)callObserver:(CXCallObserver *)callObserver callChanged:(CXCall *)call {
        if (call.hasConnected) {
            // perform necessary actions
        }
    }
