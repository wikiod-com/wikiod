## Registering device for Push Notifications
To register your device for push notifications, add the following code to your AppDelegate file in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

## Swift

    func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        if UIDevice.currentDevice().systemVersion.compare(v, options: .NumericSearch) == NSOrderedAscending { 
            // Register for Push Notitications, if running iOS < 8
            if application.respondsToSelector("registerUserNotificationSettings:") {
                let types:UIUserNotificationType = (.Alert | .Badge | .Sound)
                let settings:UIUserNotificationSettings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: types, categories: nil)
  
                application.registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)
                application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
            } else {      
                // Register for Push Notifications before iOS 8
                application.registerForRemoteNotificationTypes(.Alert | .Badge | .Sound)
            }
        } else {
            var center = UNUserNotificationCenter.currentNotificationCenter()
            center.delegate = self
            center.requestAuthorizationWithOptions((UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge)) {(granted: Bool, error: NSError) -> Void in
                if !error {
                    UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotifications()
                    // required to get the app to do anything at all about push notifications
                    print("Push registration success.")
                } else {
                    print("Push registration FAILED")
                    print("ERROR: \(error.localizedFailureReason!) - \(error.localizedDescription)")
                    print("SUGGESTIONS: \(error.localizedRecoveryOptions) - \(error.localizedRecoverySuggestion!)")
                })
        }

        return true
    }

## Objective-C

    #define SYSTEM_VERSION_LESS_THAN(v) ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] compare:v options:NSNumericSearch] == NSOrderedAscending)

    if( SYSTEM_VERSION_LESS_THAN( @"10.0" ) )

            // iOS 8 Notifications
            [application registerUserNotificationSettings:[UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:(UIUserNotificationTypeSound | UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge) categories:nil]];

                dispatch_time_t popTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(delayInSeconds * NSEC_PER_SEC));
                dispatch_after(popTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void){
                    // [self addMessageFromRemoteNotification:dictionary2 updateUI:NO];
                });
            }

        //------------------------------------------------

The above code will try to communicate with APNs server to get device token (prerequiesites are you have APNs enabled in your iOS provisioning profile).

Once it establishes reliable connection with APNs server, the server provides you a device token.

After adding the code above, add these methods to the `AppDelegate` class:

## Swift

    func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData) {
        print("DEVICE TOKEN = \(deviceToken)")
    }

    func application(application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: NSError) {
        print(error)
    }

## Objective-C

    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
    {    
    NSString * deviceTokenString = [[[[deviceToken description]
                         stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: @"<" withString: @""] 
                        stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: @">" withString: @""] 
                       stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: @" " withString: @""];

    NSLog(@"The generated device token string is : %@",deviceTokenString);
    }

    - (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError*)error
    {
        NSLog(@"Failed to get token, error: %@", error.description);
    }

The above methods are called according to registration success or failure scenario.

Success scenario calls:

## Swift

    func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData) {
        print("DEVICE TOKEN = \(deviceToken)")
    }

In Swift3:


    @objc(userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:) @available(iOS 10.0, *)
    func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, willPresent notification: UNNotification, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void)
    {
        //To show notifications in foreground.
       print("Userinfo2 \(notification.request.content.userInfo)")
    }


## Objective-C

    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
    {
    if(application.applicationState == UIApplicationStateInactive) { 
        NSLog(@"Inactive - the user has tapped in the notification when app was closed or in background");
        //do some tasks
        [self handelPushNotification:userInfo];
    }
    else if (application.applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground) {
        NSLog(@"application Background - notification has arrived when app was in background");
        [self handelPushNotification:userInfo];
    }
    else {
        NSLog(@"application Active - notication has arrived while app was opened");
        //Show an in-app banner
        //do tasks
    }
    }

Failure scenario calls:

## Swift

    func application(application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: NSError) {
        print(error)
    }

## Objective-C

    - (void)application:(UIApplication*)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError*)error

> # Note
>If none of the above methods are getting called, your device is not able to create reliable connection with APNs server, which might be because of internet access problems.

## Testing push notifications
It is always a good practice to test how push notifications work even before you have your server side ready for them, just to make sure that everything is set up correctly on your side. It is quite easy to send yourself a push notification using a following PHP script.

1. Save the script as a file (send_push.php for example) in the same folder as your certificate (development or production)
2. Edit it to put your device token, password from the certificate
3. Choose the correct path for opening a connection, dev_path or prod_path (this is where 'Open a connection to the APNS server' happens in the script)
4. cd to the folder in Terminal and run command 'php send_push'
5. Receive the notification on your device


    <?php
    
    // Put your device token here (without spaces):   
    $deviceToken = '20128697f872d7d39e48c4a61f50cb11d77789b39e6fc6b4cd7ec80582ed5229';
    // Put your final pem cert name here. it is supposed to be in the same folder as this script
    $cert_name = 'final_cert.pem';
    // Put your private key's passphrase here:
    $passphrase = '1234';
    
    // sample point
    $alert = 'Hello world!';
    $event = 'new_incoming_message';
        
    // You can choose either of the paths, depending on what kind of certificate you are using
    $dev_path = 'ssl://gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195';
    $prod_path = 'ssl://gateway.push.apple.com:2195';
        
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    
    $ctx = stream_context_create();
    stream_context_set_option($ctx, 'ssl', 'local_cert', $cert_name);
    stream_context_set_option($ctx, 'ssl', 'passphrase', $passphrase);
    
    // Open a connection to the APNS server
    $fp = stream_socket_client(
        $dev_path, $err,
        $errstr, 60, STREAM_CLIENT_CONNECT|STREAM_CLIENT_PERSISTENT, $ctx);
    
    if (!$fp)
        exit("Failed to connect: $err $errstr" . PHP_EOL);
    
    echo 'Connected to APNS' . PHP_EOL;
    
    // Create the payload body
    // it should be as short as possible
    // if the notification doesnt get delivered that is most likely
    // because the generated message is too long
    $body['aps'] = array(
                         'alert' => $alert,
                         'sound' => 'default',
                         'event' => $event
                         );
    
    // Encode the payload as JSON
    $payload = json_encode($body);
    
    // Build the binary notification
    $msg = chr(0) . pack('n', 32) . pack('H*', $deviceToken) . pack('n', strlen($payload)) . $payload;
    
    // Send it to the server
    $result = fwrite($fp, $msg, strlen($msg));
    
    if (!$result)
        echo 'Message not delivered' . PHP_EOL;
    else
        echo 'Message successfully delivered' . PHP_EOL;
    
    // Close the connection to the server
    fclose($fp);
    

## Checking if your app is already registered for Push Notification
## Swift    

    let isPushEnabled = UIApplication.sharedApplication().isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications()

## Generating a .pem certificate from your .cer file, to pass on to the server developer
1. Save aps.cer to a folder
2. Open "Keychain access" and export the key that is under that certificate to a .p12 file (call it key.p12). To do that right click on it and choose Export. Save it to the same folder as step 1. On export you will be prompted for a password. Make something up and memorize it.

    [![Exporting][1]][1]

3. cd to that folder in Terminal and execute the following commands:
4. Convert .cer to a .pem certificate


    openssl x509 -in aps.cer -inform der -out aps.pem    
    
5. Convert your key to .pem format. To open the key, enter the password you exported it with from the keychain, in step 2. Then, enter another password that will protect the exported file. You will be prompted to enter it twice for confirmation.


    openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out key.pem -in key.p12

6. Merge the files into one final file


    cat key.pem aps.pem > final_cert.pem

7. The final_cert.pem is the final result. Pass it on to server developers with the password from step 5, so that they will be able to use the protected certificate.

## Unregistering From Push Notifications
To unregister from Remote Notifications programatically you can use

Objective-C
-----------

    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] unregisterForRemoteNotifications];
Swift
-----------

    UIApplication.sharedApplication().unregisterForRemoteNotifications()

this is similar to going into the setting of your phone and manually switching off Notifications for the application.

**NOTE: There may be rare cases where you would need this(eg: when your app no longer supports push notifications)**

If you just want to allow the user to temporarily disable Notifications. You should implement a method to remove device token in the database on your server.
else if you only disable Notification locally on your device your server will still send messages.




## Setting the application icon badge number
Use the following piece of code to set the badge number from within your application (suppose `someNumber` has been declared before):

**Objective-C**

``[UIApplication sharedApplication].applicationIconBadgeNumber = someNumber;``

**Swift**

``UIApplication.shared.applicationIconBadgeNumber = someNumber``

In order to *remove* the badge completely, just set `someNumber = 0`.

## Registering for (Non Interactive) Push Notification
The logic of registering for push notification is recommended to be added in `AppDelegate.swift` as the callback functions (success, failure) will be called their. To register just do the following:

    let application = UIApplication.sharedApplication()
    let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: [.Alert, .Badge, .Sound], categories: nil)
    application.registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)

Then the callback function `didRegisterUserNotificationSettings` will be called and in that case you just trigger the register like this:

    func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterUserNotificationSettings notificationSettings: UIUserNotificationSettings) {
        application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    }

And in that case and system alert will be shown asking for persmission to receive push notification. One of the following callback functions will be called:

    func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData) {
        let tokenChars = UnsafePointer<CChar>(deviceToken.bytes)
        var tokenString = ""
        
        for i in 0..<deviceToken.length {
            tokenString += String(format: "%02.2hhx", arguments: [tokenChars[i]])
        }
        
        print("Push token: \(tokenString)")
    }
    
    func application(application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: NSError) {
        print("didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError: \(error)")
                
    }

In very rare cases, neither success or failure callback functions are called. This happens when you have internet connection problems or the APNS Sandbox is down. The system do an API call to APNS to do some verification, failing to do so will lead to none of the two callbacks functions will be called. Visit [Apple system status][1] to make sure its fine.

## Handling Push Notification
Once user clicks on a push notification, the following callback function will be called. You can parse the JSON to get any specific info sent from backend that will helps you in deep linking:

>Swift

    func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]) {
        print("Received notification: \(userInfo)")
    }

> Objective C
   
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification: (NSDictionary *)userInfo
    {
        NSLog(@"Received notification: %@", userInfo);
    }

> iOS 10

    #define SYSTEM_VERSION_GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO(v)  ([[[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion] compare:v options:NSNumericSearch] != NSOrderedAscending)

    -(void) application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void                              (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler
    {
        // iOS 10 will handle notifications through other methods
        NSLog(@"Received notification: %@", userInfo);
    
    
        if( SYSTEM_VERSION_GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO( @"10.0" ) )
        {
            NSLog( @"iOS version >= 10. Let NotificationCenter handle this one." );
            // set a member variable to tell the new delegate that this is background
            return;
        }
        NSLog( @"HANDLE PUSH, didReceiveRemoteNotification: %@", userInfo );
    
        // custom code to handle notification content
    
        if( [UIApplication sharedApplication].applicationState == UIApplicationStateInactive )
       {
           NSLog( @"INACTIVE" );
           completionHandler( UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData );
       }
       else if( [UIApplication sharedApplication].applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground )
       {  
           NSLog( @"BACKGROUND" );  
           completionHandler( UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData );  
       }  
       else  
       {  
           NSLog( @"FOREGROUND" );  
           completionHandler( UIBackgroundFetchResultNewData );  
       }  
    }

    - (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
       willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification
         withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions options))completionHandler
    {
        NSLog( @"Handle push from foreground" );
       // custom code to handle push while app is in the foreground
        NSLog(@"%@", notification.request.content.userInfo);
    }

    - (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response
         withCompletionHandler:(void (^)())completionHandler
    {
    
        NSLog( @"Handle push from background or closed" );
        // if you set a member variable in didReceiveRemoteNotification, you  will know if this is from closed or background
        NSLog(@"%@", response.notification.request.content.userInfo);
    }
