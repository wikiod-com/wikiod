## Delegate methods
//conform the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol.

    @interface ViewController : UIViewController<NSURLConnectionDelegate>
    {
        NSMutableData *_responseData;
    }

//Implementation of the NSURLConnection protocol methods.

    #pragma mark NSURLConnection Delegate Methods
     
    - (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveResponse:(NSURLResponse *)response {
        // A response has been received, this is where we initialize the instance var you created
        // so that we can append data to it in the didReceiveData method
        // Furthermore, this method is called each time there is a redirect so reinitializing it
        // also serves to clear it
        _responseData = [[NSMutableData alloc] init];
    }
     
    - (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveData:(NSData *)data {
        // Append the new data to the instance variable you declared
        [_responseData appendData:data];
    }
     
    - (NSCachedURLResponse *)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection
                      willCacheResponse:(NSCachedURLResponse*)cachedResponse {
        // Return nil to indicate not necessary to store a cached response for this connection 
        return nil;
    }
     
    - (void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection {
        // The request is complete and data has been received
        // You can parse the stuff in your instance variable now
        
    }
     
    - (void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didFailWithError:(NSError *)error {
        // The request has failed for some reason!
        // Check the error var
    }



## Synchronous Request


    NSURLRequest * urlRequest = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://google.com"]];
    NSURLResponse * response = nil;
    NSError * error = nil;
    NSData * data = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:urlRequest
                                              returningResponse:&response
                                                          error:&error];
        
    if (error == nil)
    {
        // Parse data here
    }

## Asynchronous request
    // Create the request instance.
    NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://google.com"]];
     
    // Create url connection and fire request
    NSURLConnection *conn = [[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:self];
