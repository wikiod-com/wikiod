iOS, watchOS and tvOS Simulators are great ways to test your apps without using an actual device. Here we will talk about working with Simulators.

# Different Types of Simulators


* iOS Simulator
* watchOS Simulator
* tvOS Simulator
* Touch Bar Simulator

> There is no simulator for macOS, because Xcode is run on macOS and whenever needed, it will run the apps native.
