## iOS XMPP Robbie Hanson Example with Openfire
# **SRXMPPDemo**

  Download the example and all the classes here - https://github.com/SahebRoy92/SRXMPPDemo
----------

A demo on XMPP in Objective C, with various simple and complex features implemented in it. All the features of XMPP is done by **"in band"** xmpp functions.
Few features this project contains are --


**SRXMPP** - A wrapper Singleton class that almost has all features needed for one-to-one chat application.

 - one to one chat
 - Core data implementation of chat (text message) thus having saving of previous messages, offline messages.
 - implementation of vCard(profile information of user, own and others too) from XML and Core Data provided by Robbie Hanson's own framework.
 - availability of friends status (online/offline/typing)

----------
# **Steps to follow**

You want to use this project as a reference then you can do the following-- 

**1. Installed Openfire in a live server**     - Rent a server, install openfire.

**2. Want to try it out without a hassle in your own computer** - 
You need to download, install and setup 3 things to start

**a. Java -** 
 - Download and install Java for Mac.
  
**b. XAMPP** - 
 
 - Install XAMPP is relatively easy. 
 - After installation just start the XAMPP and start **Database(SQL)** and **Apache Server**.
  ![image reference](http://i.imgur.com/mXQmnhh.png?1)
 - Then open browser and paste this URL 
[*http://localhost/phpmyadmin/*](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)
 - . Create a new DB from the left hand side panel.
 - **Name the DB anything but remember this name, suppose we name it ChatDB** 
 

**c. Openfire** -

 * Install Openfire and run the application and "Start Openfire"
 ![image reference](http://i.imgur.com/Ct8ft15.png?1)
 * Open Browser and Paste this URL - [http://localhost:9090/setup/index.jsp](http://localhost:9090/setup/index.jsp)
 * Do normal setup 
     * Select Language >
     * Server settings, leave as it is, just do continue > 
     * Database Settings, leave as it is as "Standard Database Connection as selected > 
     * Database Settings - Standard Connection". Now remember the name of the DB you set was **ChatDB**. 
     * Select Database Driver Presets as **"*MySQL"**. Leave JDBC Driver Class as it is. Now in the Database URL you can see, brackets mentioning hostname and Database Name. Just change Hostname to **"localhost"**, and database name to **"ChatDB"**, or any other name of DB you have set earlier, while seting up XAMPP.
     Leave the Username and password as blank.Fill up details like the image here 
     ![image reference](http://i.imgur.com/BKRBG3c.png?1).  
     * Next complete setup by giving a username and password and reconfirming it.
Thats it your done Setting up Openfire.

----------
Now the part comes when you have to change a tiny detail in the code.

#**Important**
  We need to go to the class - **SRXMPP.m**, locate the NSString extern **SRXMPP_Hostname** (in the top) and overwrite the value of it to the   

 - IP of the server where OpenFire is installed ,
  **OR**
 - if you have installed it locally, overwrite the value to - 
   **"localhost"**.

Thats it, you are ready to use this example project and start coding and making it into a better project of your own.

This starter pack will help you in understanding XMPP structure better as well as getting a grasp into XMPP protocols.

You can find other XMPP protocols here in this site - [https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html](https://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html)

Development is still left and parts where I hope to include them later on 

 1. Group Chat
 2. Image sending support
 

In short this example project along with the singleton has almost all features that are needed for a One-to-One chat application to have.
