##  Distance Filter using 
Example :     
 
       CLLocationManager *locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];
       locationManager.delegate = self;
       locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest;
       locationManager.distanceFilter = 5;

E.g. In the above  example code above, location changes of less than 5 metres won’t be sent to the callback, but instead be ignored.  

## Get User Location Using CLLocationManager
1 - Include the CoreLocation.framework in your project; this is accomplished by clicking on:

    root directory -> build phases -> Link Binary With Libraries

Click on the (+) button, look for CoreLocation.framework and click add.

2- Modify the info.plist file to ask for permission to use user location by opening it as source code. Add either of the following key:value pair under the <Dict> tag to ask for usage of user's location while the application is in use:

    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>message to display when asking for permission</string>

3- import CoreLocation to the ViewController that will be using it.

    import CoreLocation

4- Make sure your ViewController conforms to the CLLocationManagerDelagate protocol

    class ViewController: UIViewController,CLLocationManagerDelegate {}

After these steps, we can create a CLLocationManager object as instance variable and use it in the ViewController.

    var manager:CLLocationManager!

We do not use 'let' here because we will modify the manager to specify its delegate, minimum distance before update event, and its accuracy

    //initialize the manager
    manager = CLLocationManager()

    //specify delegate
    manager.delegate = self

    //set the minimum distance the phone needs to move before an update event is triggered (for example:  100 meters)
    manager.distanceFilter = 100

    //set Accuracy to any of the following depending on your use case

    //let kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation: CLLocationAccuracy
    //let kCLLocationAccuracyBest: CLLocationAccuracy
    //let kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters: CLLocationAccuracy
    //let kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters: CLLocationAccuracy
    //let kCLLocationAccuracyKilometer: CLLocationAccuracy
    //let kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers: CLLocationAccuracy

    manager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest

    //ask the user for permission
    manager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()

    //Start collecting location information
    if #available(iOS 9.0, *) {
                
       manager.requestLocation()
                
     } else {
      
       manager.startUpdatingLocation()
      
      }

Now to get access to the location updates, we can implement the function below which is called overtime the distanceFilter is reached.

    func locationManager(manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {}

The locations parameter is an array of CLLocation objects that represent the actual location of the device.From these objects, one can get access to the following attributes: `coordinate,altitude, floor, horizontalAccuracy, verticalAccuracy, timestamp, description, course, speed`, and a function `distance(from:)` that measures the distance between two locations. 

Note: While requesting permission for location, there are two different types of authorization.

> "When In Use" authorization only gives the app permission to receive
> your location when the app is in use or foreground.
> 
> “Always" authorization, gives the app background
> permissions which may lead to decrease battery life in case your app is closed.
> 
>Plist file should be adjusted as necessary.
