Hot to read and write data to a bluetooth low energy device.


## Some important points ##
- No capabilities are needed.
- iPhone store bytes in Little Endian format, so check if bluetooth accessory use Little Endian too. Example:
    - intel CPU usually use little endian.
    - The ARM architecture was little-endian before version 3 when it became big-endian.
- After a single or batch operation the connection will be lost, so you have to reconnect before continue.

## Scan for SERVICE UUID ##

    func SearchBLE(){
        cb_manager.scanForPeripherals(withServices:[service_uuid], options: nil)
        StopSearchBLE()
    }

----------

## How to discover SERVICE UUID without documentation ##

    func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didConnect peripheral:             
    CBPeripheral) {
            peripheral.delegate = self
            peripheral.discoverServices(nil)
    }

    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didDiscoverServices error: Error?) {
        for service in peripheral.services! {
            print("Service: \(service)\n error: \(error)")
        }
    }

- discoverServices(nil) - NIL means that all services will be returned, which is not a good option.( READ Remarks 3)
- If you haven't found the SERVICE UUID run your code and looking for in console
[![enter image description here][1]][1]


- I found have 3 services: Battery, Device information (Firmware) and FFF0
- This uuid service isn't a standard one, a list with standards can find [here][2]
- FFF0 is the SERVICE UUID in this case


----------

## Convert data to UInt16 and contrary ##

Add this extensions to your class

    protocol DataConvertible {
        init?(data: Data)
        var data: Data { get }
    }

    extension DataConvertible {
    
        init?(data: Data) {
            guard data.count == MemoryLayout<Self>.size else { return nil }
            self = data.withUnsafeBytes { $0.pointee }
        }
    
        var data: Data {
            var value = self
            return Data(buffer: UnsafeBufferPointer(start: &value, count: 1))
        }
    }
    extension UInt16 : DataConvertible {
        init?(data: Data) {
            guard data.count == MemoryLayout<UInt16>.size else { return nil }
            self = data.withUnsafeBytes { $0.pointee }
        }
        var data: Data {
            var value = CFSwapInt16HostToBig(self)
            return Data(buffer: UnsafeBufferPointer(start: &value, count: 1))
        }
    }

## Connect and read major value
- I'm in a controlled room with a single minew beacon that use IBEACON protocol.
- BLEController needs to extend CBPeripheralDelegate
- I'll use the first BLE to connect after the search has stop.
- Modify the method StopSearchBLE()

    
    class BLEController: CBCentralManagerDelegate, CBPeripheralDelegate{
    //...
        func StopSearchMiniewBeacon() {
            let when = DispatchTime.now() + 5 // change 2 to desired number of seconds
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: when) {
                self.cb_manager.stopScan()
                self.cb_manager.connect(bles.first)
            }
        }
    /...
    }
- In the documention of your BLE device, you should look for the SERVICE UUID and MAJOR UUID CHARACTERISTIC


    var service_uuid =  CBUUID(string: "0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb")
    var major_uuid =  CBUUID(string: "0000fff2-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb")
    func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didConnect peripheral:             
    CBPeripheral) {
        peripheral.delegate = self
        peripheral.discoverServices([service_uuid])
    }

    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didDiscoverServices error: Error?) {
        print("Service: \(service)\n error: \(error)")
        peripheral.discoverCharacteristics([major_uuid], for: (peripheral.services?[0])!)
    }
- Create a variable 'service_uuid' and 'major_uuid' like code above. '-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb' is part of the standard. 'fff0' is my SERVICE UUID, 'fff2' is my MAJOR UUID characteristic and '0000' are required to fill the 4 bytes uuid 1ยบ block.
- discoverCharacteristics([major_uuid], for: (peripheral.services?[0])!) will get major characteristic from my device gatt server and it will have NIL as value for now. 
- (peripheral.services?[0])! - 0 beacuse will return a single value once I did peripheral.discoverServices([service_uuid]) 


    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didDiscoverCharacteristicsFor service: CBService, error: Error?) {
        for characteristic in service.characteristics! {
            print("Characteristic: \(characteristic)\n error: \(error)")
            if(characteristic.uuid.uuidString == "FFF2"){
                peripheral.readValue(for: characteristic)
            }
        }
    }

    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didUpdateValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?) {
        print("Characteristic read: \(characteristic)\n error: \(error)")
        let major = UInt16.init(bigEndian: UInt16(data: characteristic.value!)!)
        print("major: \(major)")
    }

- Characteristic value will only be readable after call peripheral.readValue(for: characteristic)
- readValue will result in func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didUpdateValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?) with value in Data type.

## Showing names of all Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- For this example I have a controlled room with a single BLE device enable.
- Your class should extend CBCentralManagerDelegate.
- Implement the method: centralManagerDidUpdateState(_ central: CBCentralManager).
- Use global queue to not freeze the screen while searching for a device.
- Instantiate CBCentralManager and wait for callback centralManagerDidUpdateState response.


    class BLEController: CBCentralManagerDelegate{
    
    var cb_manager: CBCentralManager!
    var bles : [CBPeripheral] = []
    
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            cb_manager = CBCentralManager(delegate: self, queue: DispatchQueue.global())
        }
    
        func centralManagerDidUpdateState(_ central: CBCentralManager) {
            print("UPDATE STATE - \(central)")
        }
    }
Callback to centralManagerDidUpdateState indicates that CoreBluetooth is ready, so you can search for BLE now. Update centralManagerDidUpdateState code to search for all BLE device when it is ready.

    func centralManagerDidUpdateState(_ central: CBCentralManager) {
        print("UPDATE STATE - \(central)")
        SearchBLE()
    }

    func SearchBLE(){
        cb_manager.scanForPeripherals(withServices: nil, options: nil)
        StopSearchBLE()
    }

    func StopSearchBLE() {
        let when = DispatchTime.now() + 5 // change 5 to desired number of seconds
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: when) {
            self.cb_manager.stopScan()
        }
    }
- SearchBLE() search for BLE devices and stop searching after 5s
- cb_manager.scanForPeripherals(withServices: nil, options: nil) looks for every BLE in range with you.
- StopSearchBLE() will stop the search after 5s.
- Each BLE found will callback func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didDiscover peripheral: CBPeripheral, advertisementData: [String : Any], rssi RSSI: NSNumber)


    func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didDiscover peripheral:                                                             
        CBPeripheral, advertisementData: [String : Any], rssi RSSI: NSNumber) {
        guard let name = peripheral.name else {
            return
        }
        print(name)
        bles.append(peripheral)
    }

## Write major value
- You need discover the services and characteristic
- You don't need read value from the characteristic before writing over it.
- will continue for, for this example, after read value. Modify func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didUpdateValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?)
- Add a variable new_major and reset_characteristic


    var reset_characteristic : CBCharacteristic!
    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didDiscoverCharacteristicsFor service: CBService, error: Error?) {
        for characteristic in service.characteristics! {
            print("Characteristic: \(characteristic)\n error: \(error)")
            if(characteristic.uuid.uuidString == "FFF2"){
                peripheral.readValue(for: characteristic)
            }
            if(characteristic.uuid.uuidString == "FFFF"){
                reset_characteristic = characteristic
            }
        }
    }
    let new_major : UInt16 = 100
    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didUpdateValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?) {
        print("Characteristic read: \(characteristic)\n error: \(error)")
        let major = UInt16.init(bigEndian: UInt16(data: characteristic.value!)!)
        print("major: \(major)")
        peripheral.writeValue(new_major.data, for: characteristic, type: CBCharacteristicWriteType.withResponse)
    }

- iPhone by deafult will send and receive bytes in Little Endian format, but my device MINEW witch chipset NRF51822 have ARM archteture and need bytes in Big Endian format, so I have to swap it.
- BLE Device documentation will say what type of input and output each characteristic will have and if you can read it like above (CBCharacteristicWriteType.withResponse).


    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didWriteValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?) {
        print("Characteristic write: \(characteristic)\n error: \(error)")
        if(characteristic.uuid.uuidString == "FFF2"){
                print("Resetting")
                peripheral.writeValue("minew123".data(using: String.Encoding.utf8)!, for: reset_characteristic, type: CBCharacteristicWriteType.withResponse)
            }
        if(characteristic.uuid.uuidString == "FFFF"){
            print("Reboot finish")
            cb_manager.cancelPeripheralConnection(peripheral)
        }
    }

- To update a gatt server information you have to reboot it programmatically or save data to it and turn off and turn on manually.
- FFFF is characteristic that do it in this device.
- 'minew123' is the default password for reboot o save information in this case.
- run your app and watch you console for any error, I hope none, but you will not see the new value yet.


    func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didUpdateValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, error: Error?) {
        print("Characteristic read: \(characteristic)\n error: \(error)")
        let major = UInt16.init(bigEndian: UInt16(data: characteristic.value!)!)
        print("major: \(major)")
        //peripheral.writeValue(new_major.data, for: characteristic, type: CBCharacteristicWriteType.withResponse)
}

- Last step is to comment last line in method didUpdateValueFor and rerun the app, now you will the new value.
