An NSUserActivity object can be used to coordinate significant events in an app with the system. It is the basis for [Handoff](https://developer.apple.com/handoff/) between different devices running iOS and macOS. Additionally, it may also be used to improve public-indexing and augment or create Spotlight Search results for an app. As of iOS 10, it may also be used to coordinate interactions between your app and Siri using SiriKit.

# Activity Types
Supported activity types must be defined in your app's `Info.plist` file under the `NSUserActivityTypes` key. Activities are tied to your Developer Team ID, meaning that activity coordination is restricted between apps that have the same Team ID (e.g. "Safari" could not accept a Handoff activity from "Chrome" or vice versa).

# Becoming / Resigning the Current Activity
Marking an activity as current using `becomeCurrent` makes it available for Handoff or Spotlight Indexing. Only one activity may be current at a time. You may mark an activity as inactive without invalidating by calling `resignCurrent`.

If you `invalidate` an activity, the same instance may not be made current again. 

Do not mark an activity as current when providing it for [SiriKit](https://developer.apple.com/sirikit/).

# Search Indexing
Activities are **not** to be used as a general-purpose indexing mechanism within your app. Instead, they should only be used in response to user-initiated actions. To index all content in your app, use CoreSpotlight.

## Creating a NSUserActivity
To create a `NSUserActivity` object, your app must declare the types of activities it supports in its `Info.plist` file. Supported activities are defined by your application and should be unique. An activity is defined using a reverse-domain style naming scheme (i.e. "com.companyName.productName.activityName"). Here is what an entry in your Info.plist might look like:  

| Key    | Value  |
| ------ | ------ |
| NSUserActivityTypes   | [Array]   |
|  - item0   | com.companyName.productName.activityName01   |
|  - item1   | com.companyName.productName.activityName02   |

Once you have defined all supported activity types, you may begin to access and use them in your application's code.

To create a `NSUserActivity` object you must do the following

    // Initialize the activity object and set its type from one of the ones specified in your app's plist
    NSUserActivity *currentActivity = [[NSUserActivity alloc] initWithActivityType:@"com.companyName.productName.activityName01"];

    // Set the title of the activity.
    // This title may be displayed to the user, so make sure it is localized and human-readable
    currentActivity.title = @"Current Activity";

    // Configure additional properties like userInfo which will be included in the activity
    currentActivity.userInfo = @{@"informationKey" : @"value"};

    // Configure the activity so the system knows what may be done with it
    // It is important that you only set YES to tasks that your application supports
    // In this example, we will only enable the activity for use with Handoff
    [currentActivity setEligibleForHandoff:YES];
    [currentActivity setEligibleForSearch:NO]; // Defaults to NO
    [currentActivity setEligibleForPublicIndexing:NO]; // Defaults to NO

    // Set this activity as the current user activity
    // Only one activity may be current at a time on a device. Calling this method invalidates any other current activities.
    [currentActivity becomeCurrent];

After this, the activity above should be available for Handoff (although more work is required to properly handle the "Handoff").
