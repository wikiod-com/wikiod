MKBlockQueue allows you to create a chain of blocks and execute them one after the other in a queue. Compared with NSOperation, with MKBlockQueue you decide yourself when a block is complete and when you want the queue to continue. You can also pass data from one block to the next.

    // create the dictionary that will be sent to the blocks
    var myDictionary:Dictionary<String, Any> = Dictionary<String, Any>()
    myDictionary["InitialKey"] = "InitialValue"
    
    // create block queue
    let myBlockQueue:MKBlockQueue = MKBlockQueue()
    
    // block 1
    let b1:MKBlockQueueBlockType =
    {
        (blockQueueObserver:MKBlockQueueObserver, dictionary:inout Dictionary<String, Any>) in
    
        print("Block 1 started with dictionary: \(dictionary)")
        dictionary["Block1Key"] = "Block1Value"
    
        // tell this block is now completed
        blockQueueObserver.blockCompleted(with:&dictionary)
    
    }
    
    // block 2
    let b2:MKBlockQueueBlockType =
    {
        (blockQueueObserver:MKBlockQueueObserver, dictionary:inout Dictionary<String, Any>) in
    
        var copyOfDictionary:Dictionary<String, Any> = dictionary
    
        // test calling on main thread, async, with delay
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline:(.now() + .seconds(1)), execute:
        {
            print("Block 2 started with dictionary: \(copyOfDictionary)")
    
            copyOfDictionary["Block2Key"] = "Block2Value"
    
            // tell this block is now completed
            blockQueueObserver.blockCompleted(with:&copyOfDictionary)
        })
    }
    
    // block 3
    let b3:MKBlockQueueBlockType =
    {
        (blockQueueObserver:MKBlockQueueObserver, dictionary:inout Dictionary<String, Any>) in
    
        var copyOfDictionary:Dictionary<String, Any> = dictionary
    
        // test calling on global background queue, async, with delay
        DispatchQueue.global(qos:.background).asyncAfter(deadline:(.now() + .seconds(1)), execute:
        {
            print("Block 3 started with dictionary: \(copyOfDictionary)")
    
            copyOfDictionary["Block3Key"] = "Block3Value"
    
            // tell this block is now completed
            blockQueueObserver.blockCompleted(with:&copyOfDictionary)
        })
    }
    
    // add blocks to the queue
    myBlockQueue.addBlock(b1)
    myBlockQueue.addBlock(b2)
    myBlockQueue.addBlock(b3)
    
    // add queue completion block for the queue
    myBlockQueue.queueCompletedBlock(
    {
        (dictionary:Dictionary<String, Any>) in
        print("Queue completed with dictionary: \(dictionary)")
    })
    
    // run queue
    print("Queue starting with dictionary: \(myDictionary)")
    myBlockQueue.run(with:&myDictionary)
