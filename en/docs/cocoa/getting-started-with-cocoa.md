## Installation or Setup
**Cocoa** is Apple's API to develop apps for macOS, formerly known as OS X.  
**Cocoa** is a container framework, and contains three sub-frameworks.
- **Foundation**
- **AppKit**
- **CoreData**

**Cocoa Touch** is Apple's version of **Cocoa** to develop apps for iOS, watchOS and tvOS.  
**Cocoa Touch** contains the same sub-frameworks, except instead of **AppKit**, it contains **UIKit**.

For Apps without any UI, it is recommended to simply only include **Foundation** instead of **Cocoa**

These apps are typically written in Objective-C or Swift.

The first thing you want to install is [Xcode][1], Apple's IDE for building macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS applications.

It is available on the [Mac App Store][2] for free.

Pre-release test versions of Xcode are available from the [developer website][1] in the months following WWDC, which is required to test bleeding edge compiler/language features. These can be installed side by side with the production version of Xcode available in the Mac App Store.

After installing Xcode, you can start writing native apps for the Mac, iOS, watchOS or tvOS.

For details of getting started with a Mac App, see [Introduction to OS X][3].

For details of getting started with an iOS App, see [Getting Started with iOS][4].
