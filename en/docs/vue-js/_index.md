`Vue.js` is a rapidly growing front-end framework for `JavaScript`, inspired by `Angular.js`, `Reactive.js`, and `Rivets.js` that offers simplistic user-interface design, manipulation, and deep reactivity.

It is described as a `MVVM` patterned framework, `Model-View View-Model`, which is based on the concept of *two-way binding* data to components and views. It is incredibly fast, exceeding speeds of other top-tier `JS` frameworks, and very user friendly for easy integration and prototyping.
