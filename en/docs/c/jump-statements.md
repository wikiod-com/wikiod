## Syntax
- return val; /* Returns from the current function. val can be a value of any type that is converts to the function's return type. */
- return; /* Returns from the current void-function.  */
- break; /* Unconditionally jumps beyond the end ("breaks out") of an Iteration Statement (loop) or out of the innermost switch statement. */
- continue; /* Unconditionally jumps to the beginning of an Iteration Statement (loop).  */
- goto LBL; /* Jumps to label LBL. */
- LBL:      *statement* /* any statement in the same function. */

These are the jumps that are integrated into C by means of keywords.

C also has another jump construct, *long jump*, that is specified with a data type, `jmp_buf`, and C library calls, `setjmp` and `longjmp`.

## Using return
Returning a value
-----------------

One commonly used case: returning from `main()`

    #include <stdlib.h> /* for EXIT_xxx macros */

    int main(int argc, char ** argv)
    {
      if (2 < argc)
      {
        return EXIT_FAILURE; /* The code expects one argument: 
                                leave immediately skipping the rest of the function's code */
      }

      /* Do stuff. */

      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

Additional notes:


1. For a function having a return type as `void` (not including `void *` or related types), the `return` statement should not have any associated expression; i.e, the only allowed return statement would be `return;`.

2. For a function having a non-`void` return type, the `return` statement shall not appear without an expression.

3. For `main()` (and only for `main()`), an _explicit_ `return` statement is not required (in C99 or later). If the execution reaches the terminating `}`, an implicit value of `0` is returned.  Some people think omitting this `return` is bad practice; others actively suggest leaving it out.


Returning nothing
------------------

Returning from a `void` function

    void log(const char * message_to_log)
    {
      if (NULL == message_to_log)
      {
        return; /* Nothing to log, go home NOW, skip the logging. */
      }

      fprintf(stderr, "%s:%d %s\n", __FILE__, _LINE__, message_to_log);

      return; /* Optional, as this function does not return a value. */
    }
    
      

## Using goto to jump out of nested loops
Jumping out of nested loops would usually require use of a boolean variable with a check for this variable in the loops. Supposing we are iterating over `i` and `j`, it could look like this
    
    size_t i,j;
    for (i = 0; i < myValue && !breakout_condition; ++i) {
        for (j = 0; j < mySecondValue && !breakout_condition; ++j) {
            ... /* Do something, maybe modifying breakout_condition */
                /* When breakout_condition == true the loops end */
         }
    }   

But the C language offers the `goto` clause, which can be useful in this case. By using it with a label declared after the loops, we can easily break out of the loops.

    size_t i,j;
    for (i = 0; i < myValue; ++i) {
        for (j = 0; j < mySecondValue; ++j) {
            ...
            if(breakout_condition) 
              goto final;
        }
    }
    final:

However, often when this need comes up a `return` could be better used instead. This construct is also considered "unstructured" in structural programming theory. 

Another situation where `goto` might be useful is for jumping to an error-handler:

    ptr = malloc(N *  x);
    if(!ptr)
      goto out_of_memory;

    /* normal processing */
    free(ptr);
    return SUCCESS;

    out_of_memory:
     free(ptr); /* harmless, and necessary if we have further errors */
     return FAILURE;

Use of `goto` keeps error flow separate from normal program control flow. It is however also considered "unstructured" in the technical sense.

## Using break and continue
Immediately `continue` reading on invalid input or `break` on user request or end-of-file:

    #include <stdlib.h> /* for EXIT_xxx macros */
    #include <stdio.h>  /* for printf() and getchar() */
    #include <ctype.h> /* for isdigit() */

    void flush_input_stream(FILE * fp);


    int main(void)
    {
      int sum = 0;
      printf("Enter digits to be summed up or 0 to exit:\n");

      do
      {
        int c = getchar();
        if (EOF == c)
        {
          printf("Read 'end-of-file', exiting!\n");

          break;
        }

        if ('\n' != c)
        {
          flush_input_stream(stdin);
        }

        if (!isdigit(c))
        {
          printf("%c is not a digit! Start over!\n", c);

          continue;
        }

        if ('0' == c)
        {
          printf("Exit requested.\n");

          break;
        }

        sum += c - '0';

        printf("The current sum is %d.\n", sum);
      } while (1);

      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    void flush_input_stream(FILE * fp)
    {
      size_t i = 0;
      int c;
      while ((c = fgetc(fp)) != '\n' && c != EOF) /* Pull all until and including the next new-line. */
      {
        ++i;
      }

      if (0 != i)
      {
        fprintf(stderr, "Flushed %zu characters from input.\n", i);
      }
    }
