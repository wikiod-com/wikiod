Function pointers are pointers that point to functions instead of data types. They can be used to allow variability in the function that is to be called, at run-time.

## Syntax
- returnType (*name)(parameters)

- typedef returnType (*name)(parameters)

- typedef returnType Name(parameters);  
  Name *name;

- typedef returnType Name(parameters);  
  typedef Name *NamePtr;



## Returning Function Pointers from a Function
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    enum Op
    {
      ADD = '+',
      SUB = '-',
    };


    /* add: add a and b, return result */    
    int add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    /* sub: subtract b from a, return result */
    int sub(int a, int b)
    {
        return a - b;
    }
    
    /* getmath: return the appropriate math function */
    int (*getmath(enum Op op))(int,int)
    {
        switch (op)
        {
            case ADD:
                return &add;
            case SUB:
                return &sub;
            default:
                return NULL;
        }
    }
    
    int main(void)
    {
        int a, b, c;
        int (*fp)(int,int);
    
        fp = getmath(ADD);
    
        a = 1, b = 2;
        c = (*fp)(a, b);
        printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, c);
        return 0;
    }



## Best Practices
# Using typedef 

It might be handy to use a `typedef` instead of declaring the function pointer each time by hand.

The syntax for declaring a `typedef` for a function pointer is:

    typedef returnType (*name)(parameters);

## Example:

Posit that we have a function, `sort`, that expects a function pointer to a function `compare` such that:

> compare -  A compare function for two elements which is to
> be supplied to a sort function.
> 
> "compare" is expected to return 0 if the two elements are deemed
> equal, a positive value if the first element passed is "larger" in some
> sense than the latter element and otherwise the function returns a
> negative value (meaning that the first element is "lesser" than the latter).

Without a `typedef` we would pass a function pointer as an argument to a function in the following manner:

    void sort(int (*compare)(const void *elem1, const void *elem2)) { 
        /* inside of this block, the function is named "compare" */
    }

With a `typedef`, we'd write:

    typedef int (*compare_func)(const void *, const void *);

and then we could change the function signature of `sort` to:

    void sort(compare_func func) { 
        /* In this block the function is named "func" */
    }

both definitions of `sort` would accept any function of the form

    int compare(const void *arg1, const void *arg2) {
        /* Note that the variable names do not have to be "elem1" and "elem2" */
    }


----------

Function pointers are the only place where you should include the pointer property of the type, e.g. do not try to define types like `typedef struct something_struct *something_type`. This applies even for a structure with members which are not supposed to accessed directly by API callers, for example the stdio.h `FILE` type (which as you now will notice is not a pointer).

# Taking context pointers.

A function pointer should almost always take a user-supplied void * as a context pointer. 

## Example

    /* function minimiser, details unimportant */
    double findminimum( double (*fptr)(double x, double y, void *ctx), void *ctx)
    {
        ...
        /* repeatedly make calls like this */
        temp = (*fptr)(testx, testy, ctx);
    }

    /* the function we are minimising, sums two cubics */
    double *cubics(double x, double y, void *ctx)
    {
        double *coeffsx = ctx;
        double *coeffsy = coeffx + 4;

        return coeffsx[0] * x * x * x + coeffsx[1] * x * x + coeffsx[2] * x + coeffsx[3] +
               coeffsy[0] * y * y * y + coeffsy[1] * y * y + coeffsy[2] * y + coeffsy[3];

    } 

    void caller()
    {
        /* context, the coefficients of the cubics */
        double coeffs[8] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
        double min;

        min = findminimum(cubics, coeffs);       
    }


Using the context pointer means that the extra parameters do not need to be hard-coded into the function pointed to, or require the use globals. 

The library function `qsort()` does not follow this rule, and one can often get away without context for trivial comparison functions. But for anything more complicated, the context pointer becomes essential.

## Introduction


Just like `char` and `int`, a function is a fundamental feature of C. As such, you can declare a pointer to one: which means that you can pass _which function to call_ to another function to help it do its job. For example, if you had a `graph()` function that displayed a graph, you could pass _which function to graph_ into `graph()`.

    // A couple of external definitions to make the example clearer
    extern unsigned int screenWidth;
    extern void plotXY(double x, double y);

    // The graph() function.
    // Pass in the bounds: the minimum and maximum X and Y that should be plotted.
    // Also pass in the actual function to plot.
    void graph(double minX, double minY,
               double maxX, double maxY,
               ???? *fn) {            // See below for syntax

        double stepX = (maxX - minX) / screenWidth;
        for (double x=minX; x<maxX; x+=stepX) {

            double y = fn(x);         // Get y for this x by calling passed-in fn()

            if (minY<=y && y<maxY) {
                plotXY(x, y);         // Plot calculated point
            } // if
        } for
    } // graph(minX, minY, maxX, maxY, fn)

# Usage

So the above code will graph whatever function you passed into it - as long as that function meets certain criteria: namely, that you pass a `double` in and get a `double` out. There are many functions like that - `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `exp()` etc. - but there are many that aren't, such as `graph()` itself!

# Syntax
So how do you specify which functions you can pass into `graph()` and which ones you can't? The conventional way is by using a syntax that may not be easy to read or understand:

    double (*fn)(double); // fn is a pointer-to-function that takes a double and returns one

The problem above is that there are two things trying to be defined at the same time: the structure of the function, and the fact that it's a pointer. So, split the two definitions! But by using `typedef`, a better syntax (easier to read & understand) can be achieved.

## Assigning a Function Pointer
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    /* increment: take number, increment it by one, and return it */
    int increment(int i)
    {
        printf("increment %d by 1\n", i);
        return i + 1;
    }

    /* decrement: take number, decrement it by one, and return it */
    int decrement(int i)
    {
        printf("decrement %d by 1\n", i);
        return i - 1;
    }
    
    int main(void)
    {
        int num = 0;          /* declare number to increment */
        int (*fp)(int);       /* declare a function pointer */
    
        fp = &increment;      /* set function pointer to increment function */
        num = (*fp)(num);     /* increment num */
        num = (*fp)(num);     /* increment num a second time */

        fp = &decrement;      /* set function pointer to decrement function */
        num = (*fp)(num);     /* decrement num */
        printf("num is now: %d\n", num);
        return 0;
    }



## Mnemonic for writing function pointers
All C functions are in actuality pointers to a spot in the program memory where some code exists. The main use of a function pointer is to provide a "callback" to other functions (or to simulate classes and objects). 

The syntax of a function, as defined further down on this page is:

  returnType (*name)(parameters)

A mnemonic for writing a function pointer definition is the following procedure:

1) Begin by writing a normal function declaration: `returnType name(parameters)`
2) Wrap the function name with pointer syntax: `returnType (*name)(parameters)`
    

## Basics
Just like you can have a pointer to an **int**, **char**, **float**, **array/string**, **struct**, etc. - you can have a pointer to a function.

**Declaring the pointer** takes the _return value of the function_, the _name of the function_, and the _type of arguments/parameters it receives_. 

Say you have the following function declared and initialized:

    int addInt(int n, int m){
        return n+m;
    }

You can declare and initialize a pointer to this function:

    int (*functionPtrAdd)(int, int) = addInt; // or &addInt - the & is optional

If you have a void function it could look like this:

    void Print(void){
        printf("look ma' - no hands, only pointers!\n");
    }

Then declaring the pointer to it would be:

    void (*functionPtrPrint)(void) = Print;

**Accessing** the function itself would require dereferencing the pointer:

    sum = (*functionPtrAdd)(2, 3); //will assign 5 to sum
    (*functionPtrPrint)(); //will print the text in Print function

As seen in more advanced examples in this document, declaring a pointer to a function could get messy if the function is passed more than a few parameters. If you have a few pointers to functions that have identical "structure" (same type of return value, and same type of parameters) it's best to use the **typedef** command to save you some typing, and to make the code more clear:

    typedef int (*ptrInt)(int, int);

    int Add(int i, int j){
        return i+j;
    }

    int Multiply(int i, int j){
        return i*j;
    }

    int main()
    {
        ptrInt ptr1 = Add;
        ptrInt ptr2 = Multiply;

        printf("%d\n", (*ptr1)(2,3)); //will print 5
        printf("%d\n", (*ptr2)(2,3)); //will print 6
        return 0;
    }

You can also create an **Array of function-pointers**. If all the pointers are of the same "structure":

    int (*array[2]) (int x, int y); // can hold 2 function pointers
    array[0] = Add;
    array[1] = Multiply;

You can learn more [here][1] and [here][2]. 

It is also possible to define an array of function-pointers of different types, though that would require casting when-ever you want to access the specific function. You can learn more [here][3].
