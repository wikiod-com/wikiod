## Overview
 
The C standard describes the language syntax, the functions provided by the standard library, and the behavior of conforming C processors (roughly speaking, compilers) and conforming C programs.  With respect to behavior, the standard for the most part specifies particular behaviors for programs and processors.  On the other hand, some operations have explicit or implicit *undefined behavior* -- such operations are always to be avoided, as you cannot rely on anything about them.  In between, there are a variety of *implementation defined* behaviors.  These behaviors may vary between C processors, runtimes, and standard libraries (collectively, *implementations*), but they are consistent and reliable for any given implementation, and conforming implementations document their behavior in each of these areas.

It is sometimes reasonable for a program to rely on implementation-defined behavior.  For example, if the program is anyway specific to a particular operating environment then relying on implementation-defined behaviors general to the common processors for that environment is unlikely to be a problem.  Alternatively, one can use conditional compilation directives to select implementation-defined behaviors appropriate for the implementation in use.  In any case, it is essential to know which operations have implementation defined behavior, so as to either avoid them or to make an informed decision about whether and how to use them.

The balance of these remarks constitute a list of all the implementation-defined behaviors and characteristics specified in the C2011 standard, with references to the standard.  Many of them use [the terminology of the standard](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#3).  Some others rely more generally on the context of the standard, such as the eight stages of translating source code into a program, or the difference between hosted and freestanding implementations.  Some that may be particularly surprising or notable are presented in bold typeface.  Not all the behaviors described are supported by earlier C standards, but generally speaking, they have implementation-defined behavior in all versions of the standard that support them.

## Right shift of a negative integer
    int signed_integer = -1;

    // The right shift operation exhibits implementation-defined behavior:
    int result = signed_integer >> 1;


## Assigning an out-of-range value to an integer
    // Supposing SCHAR_MAX, the maximum value that can be represented by a signed char, is
    // 127, the behavior of this assignment is implementation-defined:
    signed char integer;
    integer = 128;

## Allocating zero bytes
    // The allocation functions have implementation-defined behavior when the requested size
    // of the allocation is zero.
    void *p = malloc(0);


## Representation of signed integers
Each signed integer type may be represented in any one of three formats; it is implementation-defined which one is used.  The implementation in use for any given signed integer type at least as wide as `int` can be determined at runtime from the two lowest-order bits of the representation of value `-1` in that type, like so:

    enum { sign_magnitude = 1, ones_compl = 2, twos_compl = 3, };
    #define SIGN_REP(T) ((T)-1 & (T)3)

    switch (SIGN_REP(long)) {
       case sign_magnitude: { /* do something */ break; }
       case ones_compl:     { /* do otherwise */ break; }
       case twos_compl:     { /* do yet else  */ break; }
       case 0:  { _Static_assert(SIGN_REP(long), "bogus sign representation"); }
    }

The same pattern applies to the representation of narrower types, but they cannot be tested by this technique because the operands of `&` are subject to "the usual arithmetic conversions" before the result is computed.
