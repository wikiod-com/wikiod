To use the predefined type `_Bool` and the header `<stdbool.h>`, you must be using the C99/C11 versions of C.

To avoid compiler warnings and possibly errors, you should only use the `typedef`/`define` example if you're using C89 and previous versions of the language.

## Using stdbool.h
<!-- if version [gte C99] -->

Using the system header file `stdbool.h` allows you to use `bool` as a Boolean data type. `true` evaluates to `1` and `false` evaluates to `0`.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdbool.h>
    
    int main(void) {
        bool x = true;  /* equivalent to bool x = 1; */
        bool y = false; /* equivalent to bool y = 0; */
        if (x)  /* Functionally equivalent to if (x != 0) or if (x != false) */
        {
            puts("This will print!");
        }
        if (!y) /* Functionally equivalent to if (y == 0) or if (y == false) */
        {
            puts("This will also print!");
        }
    }
`bool` is just a nice spelling for the data type [`_Bool`][1]. It has special rules when numbers or pointers are converted to it.

## Using #define
<!-- if version [lte C89] -->
C of all versions, will effectively treat any integer value other than `0` as `true` for comparison operators and the integer value `0` as `false`. If you don't have `_Bool` or `bool` as of C99 available, you could simulate a Boolean data type in C using `#define` macros, and you might still find such things in legacy code.


    #include <stdio.h>
    
    #define bool int
    #define true 1
    #define false 0

    int main(void) {
        bool x = true;  /* Equivalent to int x = 1; */
        bool y = false; /* Equivalent to int y = 0; */
        if (x) /* Functionally equivalent to if (x != 0) or if (x != false) */
        {
            puts("This will print!");
        }
        if (!y) /* Functionally equivalent to if (y == 0) or if (y == false) */
        {
            puts("This will also print!");
        }
    }

Don't introduce this in new code since the definition of these macros might clash with modern uses of `<stdbool.h>`.

## Using the Intrinsic (built-in)  Type _Bool
<!-- if version [gte C99] -->

Added in the C standard version C99, `_Bool` is also a native C data type. It is capable of holding the values `0` (for *false*) and `1` (for *true*). 

    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main(void) {
        _Bool x = 1; 
        _Bool y = 0;
        if(x) /* Equivalent to if (x == 1) */
        {
            puts("This will print!");
        }
        if (!y) /* Equivalent to if (y == 0) */
        {
            puts("This will also print!");
        }
    }

 `_Bool` is an integer type but has special rules for conversions from other types. The result is analogous to the usage of other types in [`if` expressions][1]. In the following

    _Bool z = X;

 - If `X` has an arithmetic type (is any kind of number), `z` becomes `0` if `X == 0`. Otherwise `z` becomes `1`. 
- If `X` has a pointer type, `z` becomes `0` if `X` is a null pointer and `1` otherwise. 

To use nicer spellings `bool`, `false` and `true` you need to use [`<stdbool.h>`][2].

## Integers and pointers in Boolean expressions.
 All integers or pointers can be used in an expression that is interpreted as "truth value".

    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
      if (argc % 4) {
        puts("arguments number is not divisible by 4");
      } else {
        puts("argument number is divisible by 4");
      }
    ...

The expression `argc % 4` is evaluated and leads to one of the values `0`, `1`, `2` or `3`. The first, `0` is the only value that is "false" and brings execution into the `else` part. All other values are "true" and go into the `if` part.

    double* A = malloc(n*sizeof *A);
    if (!A) {
       perror("allocation problems");
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

Here the pointer `A` is evaluated and if it is a null pointer, an error is detected and the program exits.

Many people prefer to write something as `A == NULL`, instead, but if you have such pointer comparisons as part of other complicated expressions, things become quickly difficult to read.

    char const* s = ....;   /* some pointer that we receive */
    if (s != NULL && s[0] != '\0' && isalpha(s[0])) {
       printf("this starts well, %c is alphabetic\n", s[0]);
    }

For this to check, you'd have to scan a complicated code in the expression and be sure about operator preference.

    char const* s = ....;   /* some pointer that we receive */
    if (s && s[0] && isalpha(s[0])) {
       printf("this starts well, %c is alphabetic\n", s[0]);
    }

is relatively easy to capture: if the pointer is valid we check if the first character is non-zero and then check if it is a letter.



## Defining a bool type using typedef
Considering that most debuggers are not aware of `#define` macros, but can check `enum` constants, it may be desirable to do something like this:

    #if __STDC_VERSION__ < 199900L
    typedef enum { false, true } bool;
    /* Modern C code might expect these to be macros. */
    # ifndef bool
    #  define bool bool
    # endif
    # ifndef true
    #  define true true
    # endif
    # ifndef false
    #  define false false
    # endif
    #else
    # include <stdbool.h>
    #endif

    /* Somewhere later in the code ... */
    bool b = true;

This allows compilers for historic versions of C to function, but remains forward compatible if the code is compiled with a modern C compiler.
