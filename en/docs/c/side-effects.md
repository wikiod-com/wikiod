## Pre/Post Increment/Decrement operators
In C, there are two unary operators - '++' and '--' that are very common source of confusion. The operator `++` is called the *increment operator* and the operator `--` is called the *decrement operator*. Both of them can be used used in either *prefix* form or *postfix* form. The syntax for prefix form for `++` operator is `++operand` and the syntax for postfix form is `operand++`. When used in the prefix form, the operand is incremented first by `1` and the resultant value of the operand is used in the evaluation of the expression. Consider the following example:

    int n, x = 5;
    n = ++x; /* x is incremented  by 1(x=6), and result is assigned to n(6) */
             /* this is a short form for two statements: */
             /* x = x + 1; */ 
             /* n = x ; */
 
When used in the postfix form, the operand's current value is used in the expression and then the value of the operand is incremented by `1`. Consider the following example:

    int n, x = 5;
    n = x++; /* value of x(5) is assigned first to n(5), and then x is incremented by 1; x(6) */
             /* this is a short form for two statements: */
             /* n = x; */
             /* x = x + 1; */


The working of the decrement operator `--` can be understood similarly. 

The following code demonstrates what each one does 

        int main()
        {
            int a, b, x = 42;
            a = ++x; /* a and x are 43 */
            b = x++; /* b is 43, x is 44 */
            a = x--; /* a is is 44, x is 43 */
            b = --x; /* b and x are 42 */
            
            return 0;
        }
From the above it is clear that post operators return the current value of a variable and *then* modify it, but pre operators modify the variable and *then* return the modified value. 

In all versions of C, the order of evaluation of pre and post operators are not defined, hence the following code can return unexpected outputs:

        int main()
        {
            int a, x = 42;
            a = x++ + x; /* wrong */
            a = x + x; /* right */
            ++x;

            int ar[10];
            x = 0;
            ar[x] = x++; /* wrong */
            ar[x++] = x; /* wrong */
            ar[x] = x; /* right */
            ++x;
            return 0;
        }

Note that it is also good practice to use pre over post operators when used alone in a statement. Look at the above code for this.

Note also, that when a function is called, all side effects on arguments must take place before the function runs.

        int foo(int x)
        {
            return x;
        }

        int main()
        {
            int a = 42;
            int b = foo(a++);  /* This returns 43, even if it seems like it should return 42 */
            return 0;
        }
