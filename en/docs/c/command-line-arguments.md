## Syntax

- int main(int argc, char *argv[])

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| argc   | argument count - initialized to the number of space-separated arguments given to the program from the command-line as well as the program name itself.  |
| argv   | argument vector - initialized to an array of `char`-pointers (strings) containing the arguments (and the program name) that was given on the command-line. |


A C program running in a 'hosted environment' (the normal type — as opposed to a 'freestanding environment') must have a `main` function. It is traditionally defined as:

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])

Note that `argv` can also be, and very often is, defined as `char **argv`; the behavior is the same.  Also, the parameter names can be changed because they're just local variables within the function, but `argc` and `argv` are conventional and you should use those names.

For `main` functions where the code does not use any arguments, use `int main(void)`.

Both parameters are initialized when the program starts:

+ `argc` is initialized to the number of space-separated arguments given to the program from the command-line as well as the program name itself.
+ `argv` is an array of `char`-pointers (strings) containing the arguments (and the program name) that was given on the command-line.
+ some systems expand command-line arguments "in the shell", others do not. On Unix if the user types  `myprogram *.txt` the program will receive a list of text files; on Windows it will receive the string "`*.txt`". 

Note: Before using `argv`, you might need to check the value of `argc`.  In theory, `argc` could be `0`, and if `argc` is zero, then there are no arguments and `argv[0]` (equivalent to `argv[argc]`) is a null pointer.
It would be an unusual system with a hosted environment if you ran into this problem.
Similarly, it is possible, though very unusual, for there to be no information about the program name.
In that case, `argv[0][0] == '\0'` — the program name may be empty.

Suppose we start the program like this:

    ./some_program abba banana mamajam

Then `argc` is equal to `4`, and the command-line arguments:
+ `argv[0]` points to `"./some_program"` (the program name) if the program name is available from the host environment. Otherwise an empty string `""`.
+ `argv[1]` points to `"abba"`,
+ `argv[2]` points to `"banana"`,
+ `argv[3]` points to `"mamajam"`,
+ `argv[4]` contains the value `NULL`.

## Print the arguments to a program and convert to integer values

The following code will print the arguments to the program, and 
the code will attempt to convert each argument into a number (to a
<code>long</code>):

    
    
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <errno.h>
    #include <limits.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    
        for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
            printf("Argument %d is: %s\n", i, argv[i]);

            errno = 0;
            char *p;
            long argument_numValue = strtol(argv[i], &p, 10);
    
            if (p == argv[i]) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Argument %d is not a number.\n", i);
            }
            else if ((argument_numValue == LONG_MIN || argument_numValue == LONG_MAX) && errno == ERANGE) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Argument %d is out of range.\n", i);
            }
            else {
                printf("Argument %d is a number, and the value is: %ld\n",
                       i, argument_numValue);
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

## Printing the command line arguments
After receiving the arguments, you can print them as follows:

    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++)
        {
            printf("Argument %d: [%s]\n", i, argv[i]); 
        }
    }

**Notes**
1. The `argv` parameter can be also defined as `char *argv[]`. 
2. `argv[0]` *may* contain the program name itself (depending on how the program was executed). The first "real" command line argument is at `argv[1]`, and this is the reason why the loop variable `i` is initialized to 1.
3. In the print statement, you can use `*(argv + i)` instead of `argv[i]` - it evaluates to the same thing, but is more verbose.
4. The square brackets around the argument value help identify the start and end.  This can be invaluable if there are trailing blanks, newlines, carriage returns, or other oddball characters in the argument.  Some variant on this program is a useful tool for debugging shell scripts where you need to understand what the argument list actually contains (although there are simple shell alternatives that are almost equivalent).


## Using GNU getopt tools
Command-line options for applications are not treated any differently from command-line arguments by the C language. They are just arguments which, in a Linux or Unix environment, traditionally begin with a dash (`-`).

With glibc in a Linux or Unix environment you can use the [getopt tools](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html) to easily define, validate, and parse command-line options from the rest of your arguments.

These tools expect your options to be formatted according to the [GNU Coding Standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Command_002dLine-Interfaces.html), which is an extension of what POSIX specifies for the format of command-line options.

The example below demonstrates handling command-line options with the GNU getopt tools.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <getopt.h>
    #include <string.h>
    
    /* print a description of all supported options */
    void usage (FILE *fp, const char *path)
    {
        /* take only the last portion of the path */
        const char *basename = strrchr(path, '/');
        basename = basename ? basename + 1 : path;
    
        fprintf (fp, "usage: %s [OPTION]\n", basename);
        fprintf (fp, "  -h, --help\t\t"
                     "Print this help and exit.\n");
        fprintf (fp, "  -f, --file[=FILENAME]\t"
                     "Write all output to a file (defaults to out.txt).\n");
        fprintf (fp, "  -m, --msg=STRING\t"
                     "Output a particular message rather than 'Hello world'.\n");
    }
    
    /* parse command-line options and print message */
    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        /* for code brevity this example just uses fixed buffer sizes for strings */
        char filename[256] = { 0 };
        char message[256] = "Hello world";
        FILE *fp;
        int help_flag = 0;
        int opt;
    
        /* table of all supported options in their long form.
         * fields: name, has_arg, flag, val
         * `has_arg` specifies whether the associated long-form option can (or, in
         * some cases, must) have an argument. the valid values for `has_arg` are
         * `no_argument`, `optional_argument`, and `required_argument`.
         * if `flag` points to a variable, then the variable will be given a value
         * of `val` when the associated long-form option is present at the command
         * line.
         * if `flag` is NULL, then `val` is returned by `getopt_long` (see below)
         * when the associated long-form option is found amongst the command-line
         * arguments.
         */
        struct option longopts[] = {
            { "help", no_argument, &help_flag, 1 },
            { "file", optional_argument, NULL, 'f' },
            { "msg", required_argument, NULL, 'm' },
            { 0 }
        };
    
        /* infinite loop, to be broken when we are done parsing options */
        while (1) {
            /* getopt_long supports GNU-style full-word "long" options in addition
             * to the single-character "short" options which are supported by
             * getopt.

             */

        return 0;
    }

It can be compiled with `gcc`:

    gcc example.c -o example

It supports three command-line options (`--help`, `--file`, and `--msg`). All have a "short form" as well (`-h`, `-f`, and `-m`). The "file" and "msg" options both accept arguments. If you specify the "msg" option, its argument is required.

Arguments for options are formatted as:
 * `--option=value` (for long-form options)
 * `-ovalue` or `-o"value"` (for short-form options)
