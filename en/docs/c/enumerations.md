Enumerations consist of the `enum` keyword and an optional *identifier* followed by an *enumerator-list* enclosed by braces.

An *identifier* is of  type `int`.

The *enumerator-list* has at least one *enumerator* element.

An *enumerator* may optionally be "assigned" a constant expression of type `int`.

An *enumerator* is constant and is compatible to either a `char`, a signed integer or an unsigned integer. Which ever is used is [implementation-defined][1]. In any case the type used should be able to represent all values defined for the enumeration in question.

If no constant expression is "assigned" to an *enumerator* and it is the 1<sup>st</sup> entry in an *enumerator-list* it takes value of `0`, else it get takes the value of the previous entry in the *enumerator-list* plus 1.

Using multiple "assignments" can lead to different *enumerators* of the same enumeration carry the same values.

## Enumeration with duplicate value
An enumerations value in no way needs to be unique:

    #include <stdlib.h> /* for EXIT_SUCCESS */
    #include <stdio.h> /* for printf() */
 

    enum Dupes
    {
       Base, /* Takes 0 */
       One, /* Takes Base + 1 */
       Two, /* Takes One + 1 */
       Negative = -1,
       AnotherZero /* Takes Negative + 1 == 0, sigh */
    };

    int main(void)
    {
      printf("Base = %d\n", Base);
      printf("One = %d\n", One);
      printf("Two = %d\n", Two);
      printf("Negative = %d\n", Negative);
      printf("AnotherZero = %d\n", AnotherZero);

      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

The sample prints:

    Base = 0
    One = 1
    Two = 2
    Negative = -1
    AnotherZero = 0


## enumeration constant without typename
Enumeration types can also be declared without giving them a name:

      enum { buffersize = 256, };
      static unsigned char buffer [buffersize] = { 0 };

This enables us to define compile time constants of type `int` that can as in this example be used as array length.

## Simple Enumeration
An enumeration is a user-defined data type consists of integral constants and each integral constant is given a name. Keyword `enum` is used to define enumerated data type.

If you use `enum` instead of `int` or `string/ char*`, you increase compile-time checking and avoid errors from passing in invalid constants, and you document which values are legal to use.

Example 1
---------

    enum color{ RED, GREEN, BLUE };
    
    void printColor(enum color chosenColor)
    {
        const char *color_name = "Invalid color";
        switch (chosenColor)
        {
           case RED:
             color_name = "RED";
             break;
           
           case GREEN:
            color_name = "GREEN";
            break;    

           case BLUE:
            color_name = "BLUE";
            break;
        }
        printf("%s\n", color_name);
    }

With a main function defined as follows (for example):

    int main(){
        enum color chosenColor;
        printf("Enter a number between 0 and 2");
        scanf("%d", (int*)&chosenColor);
        printColor(chosenColor);
        return 0;
    }

<!-- if version [gte c99] -->

Example 2
---------

<sup>(This example uses designated initializers which are standardized since C99.)</sup>

    enum week{ MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN };
         
    static const char* const dow[] = { 
      [MON] = "Mon", [TUE] = "Tue", [WED] = "Wed", 
      [THU] = "Thu", [FRI] = "Fri", [SAT] = "Sat", [SUN] = "Sun" };
        
    void printDayOfWeek(enum week day) 
    { 
       printf("%s\n", dow[day]);
    }


The same example using range checking:

 
    enum week{ DOW_INVALID = -1, 
      MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN, 
      DOW_MAX };
         
    static const char* const dow[] = { 
      [MON] = "Mon", [TUE] = "Tue", [WED] = "Wed", 
      [THU] = "Thu", [FRI] = "Fri", [SAT] = "Sat", [SUN] = "Sun" };
        
    void printDayOfWeek(enum week day) 
    { 
       assert(day > DOW_INVALID && day < DOW_MAX);
       printf("%s\n", dow[day]);
    }
<!-- end version if -->

## Typedef enum
There are several possibilities and conventions to name an enumeration. The first is to use a *tag name* just after the `enum` keyword.

    enum color
    { 
        RED, 
        GREEN, 
        BLUE 
    };

This enumeration must then always be used with the keyword *and* the tag like this: 

    enum color chosenColor = RED;


If we use `typedef` directly when declaring the `enum`, we can omit the tag name and then use the type without the `enum` keyword:

    typedef enum 
    { 
        RED, 
        GREEN, 
        BLUE 
    } color;

    color chosenColor = RED;

But in this latter case we cannot use it as `enum color`, because we didn't use the tag name in the definition. One common convention is to use both, such that the same name can be used with or without `enum` keyword. This has the particular advantage of being compatible with [C++](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%2b%2b/topics)

    enum color                /* as in the first example */
    { 
        RED, 
        GREEN, 
        BLUE 
    };
    typedef enum color color; /* also a typedef of same identifier */

    color chosenColor  = RED;
    enum color defaultColor = BLUE;

Function:

    void printColor()
    {
        if (chosenColor == RED)
        {
            printf("RED\n");
        }
        else if (chosenColor == GREEN)
        {
            printf("GREEN\n");    
        }
        else if (chosenColor == BLUE)
        {
            printf("BLUE\n");
        }
    }
