## tools list

    Cortical.io - Retina: an API performing complex NLP operations (disambiguation, classification, streaming text filtering, etc...) as quickly and intuitively as the brain.
    CoreNLP - Stanford CoreNLP provides a set of natural language analysis tools which can take raw English language text input and give the base forms of words
    Stanford Parser - A natural language parser is a program that works out the grammatical structure of sentences
    Stanford POS Tagger - A Part-Of-Speech Tagger (POS Tagger
    Stanford Name Entity Recognizer - Stanford NER is a Java implementation of a Named Entity Recognizer.
    Stanford Word Segmenter - Tokenization of raw text is a standard pre-processing step for many NLP tasks.
    Tregex, Tsurgeon and Semgrex - Tregex is a utility for matching patterns in trees, based on tree relationships and regular expression matches on nodes (the name is short for "tree regular expressions").
