## Supervised Learning
The machine learns to predict an output when given an input. 

Each training case consists of an input and a target output.


Regression
=======

The target ouput takes continuous values.

 - Predicting the price of a stock
 - Predicting a house price

Classification
=======
The target output is a class label.

 - What kind of fruit the input is
 - [What language a word is][1]

## Reinforcement Learning
The machine has to automatically determine the ideal behavior to maximize its performance.

For example:

Using reinforcement learning you can also make a computer program that can complete a Mario level ([MarI/O - Machine Learning for Video Games][2]).

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can **derive structure from data** where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.

The most common type of unsupervised learning is **cluster analysis or clustering**. It is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that object in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. 

There is also non-clustering unsupervised learning. An example thereof is identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds. This is called the ["Cocktail Party Algorithm".][1]
