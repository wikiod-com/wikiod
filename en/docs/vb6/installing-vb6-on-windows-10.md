## Installation Wizard
[Visual Studio 6.0 Installer wizard](http://nuke.vbcorner.net/Articles/VB60/VisualStudio6Installer/tabid/93/language/en-US/Default.aspx)

By default, the following packages do not install properly under Windows 10:
- Visual Studio 6 Enterprise
- Visual Studio 6 Professional
- Visual Basic 6 Enterprise
- Visual Basic 6 Professional

To install the above packages, you'll either need to make numerous adjustments and registry hacks, or use the fantastic [Visual Studio 6.0 Installer wizard](http://nuke.vbcorner.net/Articles/VB60/VisualStudio6Installer/tabid/93/language/en-US/Default.aspx) by Giorgio Brausi.

You'll need the following items before starting:
- Your original Visual Studio/Basic Program CDs and keys
- Your original MSDN CDs
- Visual Studio Service Pack 6
- [Visual Studio 6.0 Installer wizard](http://nuke.vbcorner.net/Articles/VB60/VisualStudio6Installer/tabid/93/language/en-US/Default.aspx)
- On Windows 10 build 1511 or later, you'll require Admin Rights.

The [Wizard](http://nuke.vbcorner.net/Articles/VB60/VisualStudio6Installer/tabid/93/language/en-US/Default.aspx) will take you through the necessary steps for a successful installation of Visual Basic 6.

Note that the installation of the Server Applications is not currently possible.
