Not all HTML tags are of the same structure. While most elements require an opening tag, a closing tag, and contents, some elements - known as void elements - only require an opening tag as they themselves do not contain any elements. This topic explains and demonstrates the proper usage of void elements in HTML

A void element cannot have any content but may have attributes. Void elements are self-closing, so they must not have a closing tag. 

[In HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/syntax.html#void-elements), the following elements are void:

* `area`
* `base`
* `br`
* `col`
* `embed`
* `hr`
* `img`
* `input`
* `keygen`
* `link`
* `meta`
* `param`
* `source`
* `track`
* `wbr`



## Void elements
HTML 4.01/XHTML 1.0 Strict includes the following void elements:

 - `area` - clickable, defined area in an image
 - `base` - specifies a base URL from which all links base
 - `br` - line break
 - `col` - column in a table [deprecated]
 - `hr` - horizontal rule (line)
 - `img` - image
 - `input` - field where users enter data
 - `link` - links an external resource to the document
 - `meta` - provides information about the document
 - `param` - defines parameters for plugins

HTML 5 standards include all non-deprecated tags from the previous list and 

 - `command` - represents a command users can invoke [obsolete]
 - `keygen` - facilitates public key generation for web certificates [deprecated]
 - `source` - specifies media sources for `picture`, `audio`, and `video` elements

The example below does **not** include void elements:

    <div>
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">
            <h3>Click here to visit <i>Stack Overflow!</i></h3>
        </a>
        <button onclick="alert('Hello!');">Say Hello!</button>
        <p>My favorite language is <b>HTML</b>. Here are my others:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

Notice how every element has an opening tag, a closing tag, and text or other elements inside the opening and closing tags. Void tags however, are shown in the example below:

    <img src="https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/company/img/logos/so/so-icon.png" />
    <br>
    <hr>
    <input type="number" placeholder="Enter your favorite number">

With the exception of the img tag, all of these void elements have only an opening tag. The img tag, unlike any other tag, has a self closing `/` before the greater than sign of the opening tag. It is best practice to have a space before the slash.
