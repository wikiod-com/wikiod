The `<progress>` element is not supported in versions of Internet Explorer less than 10

The `<progress>` element is the wrong element to be used for something that is just a gauge, rather than the task progress. For example, showing the usage of disk space by using the `<progress>` element is inappropriate. Instead, the `<meter>` element is available for this type of use cases.

## Progress
The `<progress>` element is new in HTML5 and is used to represent the progress of a task

    <progress value="22" max="100"></progress>

This creates a bar filled 22%



## Changing the color of a progress bar
Progress bars can be styled with the `progress[value]` selector.

This example gives a progress bar a width of `250px` and a height of `20px`

    progress[value] {
      width: 250px;
      height: 20px;
    }

Progress bars can be especially difficult to style.

### Chrome / Safari / Opera

These browsers use the `-webkit-appearance` selector to style the progress tag. To override this, we can reset the appearance.

    progress[value] {
      -webkit-appearance: none;
      appearance: none;
    }

Now, we can style the container itself

    progress[value]::-webkit-progress-bar {
      background-color: "green";
    }

## Firefox

Firefox styles the progress bar a little differently. We have to use these styles

    progress[value] {
      -moz-appearance: none;
      appearance: none;
      border: none;                /* Firefox also renders a border */
    }

## Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer 10+ supports the `progress` element. However, it does not support the `background-color` property. You'll need to use the color property instead.

    progress[value]  {
      -webkit-appearance: none;
         -moz-appearance: none;
              appearance: none;
    
      border: none;                       /* Remove border from Firefox */
    
      width: 250px;
      height: 20px;

      color: blue; 
    }

## HTML Fallback
For browsers that do not support the `progress` element, you can use this as a workaround.

    <progress max="100" value="20">
        <div class="progress-bar">
            <span style="width: 20%;">Progress: 20%</span>
        </div>
    </progress>

Browsers that support the progress tag will ignore the div nested inside. Legacy browsers which cannot identify the progress tag will render the div instead.
