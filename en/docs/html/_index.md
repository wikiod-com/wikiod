[HTML][1] (**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) is an [XML][2]-compliant system of  annotating documents with 'tags'. It is used specifically to create content for web pages and web applications, which can then be shared over a network.

Apart from text, the current version of HTML supports many different [types of media][3], including images and videos.
