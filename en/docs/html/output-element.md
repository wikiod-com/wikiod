## Parameters
| Attribute | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Global   | Attributes that are available to any HTML5 element. For comprehensive documentation of these attributes see: [MDN Global Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) |
| name | A string representing the name of an output. As a form element, output can be referenced by it's name using the `document.forms` property. This attribute is also used for collecting values on a form submit. |
| for | A space separated list of form element ids (e.g. `<inputs id="inp1"> for value is "inp1"`) that the output is meant to display calculations for. |
| form | A string representing the `<form>` that is associated to the output. If the output is actually outside the `<form>`, this attribute will ensure that the output still belongs to the `<form>` and subject to collections and submits of said `<form>`. |
 


## Output Element Using For and Form Attributes
The following demo features an `<output>` element's use of the `[for]` and `[form]` attributes. Keep in mind, `<output>` **needs JavaScript** in order to function. Inline JavaScript is commonly used in forms as this example demonstrates. Although the `<input>` elements are `type="number"`, their `value`s are not numbers, they are text. So if you require the `value`s to be calculated, you must convert each `value` into a number using methods such as: `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, `Number()`, etc.

[**Live Demo**][1]

        <!--form1 will collect the values of in1 and in2 on 'input' event.-->
        <!--out1 value will be the sum of in1 and in2 values.-->    

    <form id="form1" name="form1" oninput="out1.value = parseInt(in1.value, 10) + parseInt(in2.value, 10)">

      <fieldset>

        <legend>Output Example</legend>

          <input type="number" id="in1" name="in1" value="0">
        <br/>
        +
        <input type="number" id="in2" name="in2" value="0">

      </fieldset>
    
    </form>

    <!--[for] attribute enables out1 to display calculations for in1 and in2.-->
    <!--[form] attribute designates form1 as the form owner of out1 even if it isn't a descendant.-->

    <output name="out1" for="in1 in2" form="form1">0</output>
