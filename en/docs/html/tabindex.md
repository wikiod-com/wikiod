## Parameters
| Value| Meaning |
|------|--------|
|negative | element will be focusable, but it should not be reachable via sequential keyboard navigation|
|0 | element will be focusable and reachable through keyboard sequential navigation, but it's relative order is defined by the platform convention|
| positive| element must be focusable and accessible via sequential keyboard navigation; it's relative order will be defined by the attribute value: the sequential follow the increasing number of the `tabindex` |


The maximum value for `tabindex` should not exceed 32767 as per W3C section 17.11.1 
 Unless specified default value is -1

An element with a value of 0, an invalid value, or no `tabindex` value should be placed after the elements with a positive index in the sequential order of keyboard navigation.

## Add an element to the tabbing order
    <div tabindex="0">Some button</div>

**Note**: Try to use a native HTML `button` or an `a` tag where appropriate.

## Remove an element from the tabbing order
    <button tabindex="-1">This button will not be reachable by tab</button>
The element will be removed from the tabbing order but will still be focusable.

## Define a custom tabbing order (not recommended)
    <div tabindex="2">Second</div>
    <div tabindex="1">First</div>
Positive values will insert the element at the tabbing order position of its respective value. Elements without preference (i.e. `tabindex="0"` or native elements such as `button` and `a`) will be appended after those with preference.

Positive values are **not recommended** as they disrupt the expected behavior of tabbing and might confuse people who rely on screenreaders. Try to create a natural order by rearranging your DOM structure.
