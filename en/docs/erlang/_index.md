"Erlang is a programming language originally developed at the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory. OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a collection of middleware and libraries in Erlang. Erlang/OTP has been battle tested in a number of Ericsson products for building robust fault-tolerant distributed applications, for example AXD301 (ATM switch). Erlang/OTP is currently maintained by the Erlang/OTP unit at Ericsson" ([erlang.org][1])
