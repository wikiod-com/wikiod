|2011|The password you entered is incorrect.|
|2014|You have given this _1 the same name as an existing _2 in your database. You can't give a table and a query the same name. Give this object a name that isn't already used by another table or query. |
|2015|There are no registered wizards of this type. Rerun Microsoft Access or Microsoft Office Setup to reinstall the wizards. If you want to preserve your security or custom settings, back up the Microsoft Access workgroup information file. For more information on backing up files, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'backing up files'. |
|2016|You can't modify the attributes of System Tables.|
|2017|Microsoft helps protect this Visual Basic for Applications Project with a password. You must supply the password in the Visual Basic Editor before you can perform this operation.|
|2018|The data access page name '_' you entered is misspelled or refers to a data access page that isn't open or doesn't exist. |
|2019|The number you used to refer to the data access page is invalid. Use the Count property to count the open data access pages and make sure that the page number is not greater than the number of open data access pages minus one. |
|2021|One or more operators in the filter expression is invalid. For a valid list of operators refer to the help file. |
|2022|You entered an expression that requires a data access page to be the active window. |
|2024|The report snapshot was not created because you don't have enough free disk space for temporary work files. To fix this, free up disk space (for example, empty the Recycle Bin or delete unnecessary files). |
|2025|The file is not in the correct format for a Microsoft Access project. |
|2027|This operation is not supported for Microsoft Access 1.X databases. |
|2028|Microsoft Access was unable to close the database object.|
|2029|Microsoft Office applications cannot suspend while you have documents open from a network location. Exit the applications or close the open documents and try again.|
|2030|The Microsoft Access project '_1' will be opened read-only because one of the following occurred: Either the file is locked for editing by another user, the file (or the folder in which it is located) is marked as read-only, or you specified that you wanted to open the file read-only.|
|2031|You can't convert or enable an MDE file. |
|2033|Name conflicts with existing module, project, or object library. |
|2034|Cannot Compile Project. |
|2035|Cannot Load Project of wrong version. |
|2037|Microsoft Access could not perform name AutoCorrect during this operation. The 'Log name AutoCorrect' option is set, but the Data and Misc. Objects is not checked out. |

|2040|Microsoft Access can't run. |
|2041|Microsoft Access couldn't find file '_1'. This file is required for startup.|
|2042|A system error occurred, or there isn't enough free memory to start Microsoft Access. Close unneeded programs and try again.|
|2043|Microsoft Access can't find the database file '_1.' Make sure you entered the correct path and file name. |
|2044|You can't exit Microsoft Access now. If you're running a Visual Basic module that is using OLE or DDE, you may need to interrupt the module. |
|2045|The command line you used to start Microsoft Access contains an option that Microsoft Access doesn't recognize. Exit and restart Microsoft Access using valid command-line options. |
|2046|The command or action '_1' isn't available now. * You may be in a read-only database or an unconverted database from an earlier version of Microsoft Access. * The type of object the action applies to isn't currently selected or isn't in the active view. Use only those commands and macro actions that are currently available for this database.  |
|2048|There isn't enough free memory to open the file '_.' Close unneeded programs and try again. For more information on freeing memory, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'memory, troubleshooting'. |
|2050|Enter an OLE/DDE Timeout setting from 0 through 300 seconds. |
|2051|The object name '_1' can't be longer than _2 characters according to Microsoft Access object-naming rules. |

|2055|The expression '_' you entered is invalid. |
|2056|Microsoft Access can't supply context-sensitive Help. |
|2057|There isn't enough stack memory left to perform the operation. The operation is too complicated. Try simplifying the operation. |
|2058|The file '_1' is incompatible. Microsoft Access needs to be reinstalled. Run Setup to reinstall Microsoft Access. If you want to preserve your security or custom settings, back up the Microsoft Access workgroup information file. For more information on backing up files, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'backing up files'. |
|2059|Microsoft Access cannot find the object '_1'. Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name correctly. |
|2060|You can't create a field list based on the action query '_â€™. Action queries don't have fields. A form or report must be based on a table, or on a select or crosstab query. Change the RecordSource property for the form or report, or open the action query and change it to a select query.  |
|2061|Enter a zero or greater-than-zero number for this option. |
|2062|The command name must be shorter than 255 Characters. Please choose a name. |
|2063|Microsoft Access can't create, open, or write to the index file '_1'; the information (.inf) file it uses to keep track of dBASE indexes. The index file may be damaged, or you may not have read/write permission for the network drive you're trying to link to. You can link to the dBASE file without specifying any dBASE indexes, but the existing indexes will not be used with the linked table.  |
|2064|The menu bar value '_' is invalid. You supplied an argument to the DoMenuItem method that refers to a menu bar that is invalid. Use an intrinsic constant or numeric value that refers to a valid menu bar value, such as acFormbar.  |
|2065|The name for the menu, command, or subcommand you entered is invalid. You supplied an argument to the DoMenuItem method that refers to a menu name, command, or subcommand that is invalid. Use an intrinsic constant or numeric value that refers to a valid menu, command, or subcommand value, such as acRecordsMenu.  |
|2067|A menu bar macro can only be run if the menu bar macro name is the setting used by particular properties or options. You tried to run a menu bar macro containing the AddMenu action. Set one of the following properties or options to the name of the menu bar macro: * The MenuBar property of a form or report. * The ShortcutMenuBar property of a form, report, or control. * The Menu Bar or Shortcut Menu Bar option in the Startup dialog box. This error also occurs if Microsoft Access attempts to run a menu bar macro containing an AddMenu action that follows an action that makes some other object the active object. For example, the OpenForm action. |
|2068|The selected item is customized and doesn't have context-sensitive Help. For more information on creating custom Help for a form, report, or control, click Help. |
|2069|The key or key combination _1 in _2 has invalid syntax or is not allowed. Use the SendKeys syntax to specify the key or key combinations. For the allowed key or key combinations, click Help. |
|2070|You already assigned the key or key combination _1 in _2 to another macro. Only the first key or key combination will be used. |
|2071|The Docking property can't be set to '_1' at this time. If you want to set the Docking property to '_2', move the toolbar from its current position and try again. |
|2072|All objects were imported successfully.|
|2073|Successfully exported '_'.|
|2074|This operation is not supported within transactions. |
|2075|This operation requires an open database. |
|2076|Successfully linked '_'.|
|2077|This Recordset is not updatable|
|2078|Help isn't available due to lack of memory or improper installation of Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Access. For more information on troubleshooting a low memory problem, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'memory, troubleshooting'. If you need to reinstall Microsoft Access, you may want to preserve your security or custom settings. To do so, back up the Microsoft Access workgroup information file. For more information on backing up files, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'backing up files'.  |
|2079|Form is read-only, because the Unique Table property is not set.|
|2080|The toolbar or menu _ already exists. Do you want to replace the existing toolbar or menu? |
|2081|The Create From Macro command only works when a macro is selected in the Navigation Pane. |
|2083|The database '_' is read-only. You can't save changes made to data or object definitions in this database. |
|2084|Field '_' is based on an expression and can't be edited|
|2085|The ODBC Refresh Interval setting must be from 1 through 32,766 seconds. |
|2086|Recordset requires a form to be updatable.|
|2087|Microsoft Access can't display the Add-ins submenu. The Add-ins submenu expression '_1' you entered exceeds the 256-character limit. Shorten the macroname or functionname expression in the Menu Add-ins key of the Windows Registry setting, and then restart Microsoft Access. For more information on customizing Microsoft Access settings in the Windows Registry, click Help.  |
|2088|Microsoft Access can't display the Add-ins submenu _1 because a setting you entered in the Windows Registry is missing a macro name or function name expression.  Supply the missing expression in the Menu Add-ins key of the Windows Registry, and then restart Microsoft Access. For more information on customizing Microsoft Access settings in the Windows Registry, click Help.|
|2089|Microsoft Access can't display the same menu more than once in a menu bar. |
|2090|An action within the current global menu's macro group can't change the global menu bar. Microsoft Access can't display the global menu bar because the macro called when you first set the global menu includes another action that tries to reset the global menu. Check your menu bar macros, and make sure that you set the global menu bar only once.  |
|2091|'_' is an invalid name. |
|2092|The value you specified for the Setting argument in the SetOption method is not the correct type of Variant for this option. You specified a string when Microsoft Access expected a number. See the Access Options dialog box (click the File tab, and then click Access Options) to see what type of data is required to set this particular option. For example, the setting for the Default Database Folder option must be a string. To see what type of Variant you passed to the SetOption method, use the VarType function. For more information, search the Help index for 'Variant data type' and 'VarType function'.  |
|2093|The numeric value for the Setting argument in the SetOption method does not correspond to any list box or option group settings in the Access Options dialog box. Valid settings are 0 (the first item in the list) through _ (the last item in the list). |
|2094|Microsoft Access cannot find the toolbar '_1â€™. You tried to run a macro that includes a ShowToolbar action or a Visual Basic for Applications procedure that includes a ShowToolbar method. * The toolbar name might be misspelled or might refer to a legacy toolbar that is no longer available. * This action might refer to a custom toolbar that was deleted from or renamed in the current database. * This action might refer to a custom toolbar that exists in a different database. |
|2097|The table for which you tried to create an import/export specification was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Access. To convert this database to the current version of Microsoft Access, click the File tab, and then click 'Convert'. |
|2098|The operation could not be completed because the Action Tag '_' is not recognized by your system. |
|2100|The control or subform control is too large for this location. The number you entered for the Left, Top, Height, or Width property is too large or is a negative number. Reduce the size of the control or subform control, or enter a positive number. |
|2101|The setting you entered isn't valid for this property. To see the valid settings for this property, search the Help index for the name of the property. |
|2102|The form name '_' is misspelled or refers to a form that doesn't exist. If the invalid form name is in a macro, an Action Failed dialog box will display the macro name and the macro's arguments after you click OK. Open the Macro window, and enter the correct form name. |
|2103|The report name '_' you entered in either the property sheet or macro is misspelled or refers to a report that doesn't exist. If the invalid report name is in a macro, an Action Failed dialog box will display the macro name and the macro's arguments after you click OK. Open the Macro window, and enter the correct report name. |
|2104|You entered the control name '_,' which is already in use. You already have a control on the form with this name, or an existing control has its name mapped to this name for Visual Basic. Visual Basic maps spaces in control names to underscores. For example, My Control and My_Control are treated as duplicate names. |
|2105|You can't go to the specified record. You may be at the end of a recordset. |
|2106|_1 errors occurred when you loaded the form or report. You loaded a form or report that has controls or properties that Microsoft Access doesn't recognize and will ignore. |
|2107|The value you entered does not meet the validation rule defined for the field or control. To see the validation rule, switch to Design view or Layout view, click the appropriate field, and then, if the property sheet is not open, press F4. Then, click the Data tab in the property sheet. Enter a value that meets the validation rule, or press ESC to undo your changes.  |
|2108|You must save the field before you execute the GoToControl action, the GoToControl method, or the SetFocus method. You tried to move the focus to another control using the SetFocus method, GoToControl action, or the GoToControl method. Set the macro or method to the AfterUpdate property instead of the BeforeUpdate property so it saves the field before changing the focus.  |
|2109|There is no field named '_' in the current record. |
|2110|Microsoft Access can't move the focus to the control _1. * The control may be a type that can't receive the focus, such as a label. * The control's Visible property may be set to No. * The control's Enabled property may be set to No. |
|2111|The changes you made can't be saved. The save operation may have failed due to the temporary locking of the records by another user. * Click OK to try again. You may need to click OK several times (or wait until the other user closes the table). * Click Cancel if repeated attempts to save your changes fail. |
|2112|The item on the Clipboard can't be pasted into this control. |
|2113|The value you entered isn't valid for this field. For example, you may have entered text in a numeric field or a number that is larger than the FieldSize setting permits. |
|2114|Microsoft Access doesn't support the format of the file '_1,' or file is too large. Try converting the file to BMP format. |
|2115|The macro or function set to the BeforeUpdate or ValidationRule property for this field is preventing Microsoft Access from saving the data in the field. * If this is a macro, open the macro in the Macro window and remove the action that forces a save (for example, GoToControl). * If the macro includes a SetValue action, set the macro to the AfterUpdate property of the control instead. * If this is a function, redefine the function in the Module window. |
|2116|The value violates the validation rule for the field or record. For example, you might have changed a validation rule without verifying whether the existing data matches the new validation rule. Click Undo to restore the previous value, or enter a new value that meets the validation rule for the field or record.  |
|2117|Microsoft Access has canceled the Paste operation. The text on the Clipboard is too long to paste into the form. For example, you may have pasted too much text into a label or entered too much text in the ColumnWidths property. Paste smaller sections. For labels, you must paste fewer than 2,048 characters.  |
|2118|You must save the current field before you run the Requery action. * If you are running a macro from the Navigation Pane, save the field first, and then run the macro. * If the macro name is the setting of the BeforeUpdate property in a Visual Basic function, set the AfterUpdate property to the name of the macro instead. |
|2119|The Requery action can't be used on the control '_'.  Certain controls, such as labels and rectangles, can't receive the focus; therefore, you can't apply a Requery action to them. |
|2120|To create a form, report or data access page using this wizard, you must first select the table or query on which the form, report or data access page will be based. |
|2121|Microsoft Access can't open the form '_1'. It contains data that Microsoft Access doesn't recognize. Re-create the form or, if you maintain backup copies of your database, retrieve a copy of the form. |
|2122|You can't view a form as a continuous form if it contains a subform, an ActiveX control, a bound chart or a Web browser control. Set the DefaultView property of the form to Single Form, Datasheet, PivotTable, or PivotChart. |
|2123|The control name you entered doesn't follow Microsoft Access object-naming rules. |
|2124|The form name you entered doesn't follow Microsoft Access object-naming rules. |
|2125|The setting for the FontSize property must be from 1 through 127. |
|2126|The setting for the ColumnCount property must be from 1 through 255. |
|2127|The setting for the BoundColumn property can't be greater than the setting for the ColumnCount property. |
|2128|Microsoft Access encountered errors while importing _1. For more detailed error information, see the file '_2'. |
|2129|The setting for the DefaultEditing property must be Allow Edits, Read Only, Data Entry, or Can't Add Records. Enter 1, 2, 3, or 4 for the DefaultEditing property. |
|2130|The settings for the GridX and GridY properties must be from 1 through 64. |
|2131|An expression can't be longer than 2,048 characters. |
|2132|The setting for the DecimalPlaces property must be from 0 through 15, or 255 for Auto (default). |
|2133|You can't place a form (or report) within itself. Select or enter a different form or report to serve as the subform or subreport. |
|2134|The setting for the Width property must be from 0 through 22 inches (55.87 cm). |
|2135|This property is read-only and can't be set. |
|2136|To set this property, open the form or report in Design view. For more information on this property, search the Help index for the name of the property. |
|2137|You can't use Find or Replace now. The fields are not searchable due to one of the following: * The fields are controls (such as buttons or OLE objects). * The fields have no data. * There are no fields to search. |
|2138|You can't search the field for the specified value. Resolve the error given in the previous error message before you attempt to search again. |
|2139|You can't replace the current value of the field with the replacement text. Resolve any errors before making further replacements. |
|2140|Microsoft Access cannot save the change you made to the record in the Replace operation for the reason shown in the previous message. Click Undo or enter a new value in the field. |
|2141|Microsoft Access can't find the text you specified in the Find What box. |
|2142|The FindRecord action requires a Find What argument. You tried to run a macro set to one of the current field's properties, but you left the Find What argument blank. When you click OK, an Action Failed dialog box will display the macro name and the macro's arguments. In the Macro window, enter text or an expression for the Find What argument, and try the Search operation again.  |
|2143|You didn't specify search criteria with a FindRecord action. In the Macro window, insert a FindRecord action before the FindNext action. |
|2144|The setting for the ListRows property must be from 1 through 255. |
|2145|The ColumnWidths property setting must be a value from 0 through 22 inches (55.87 cm) for each column in a list box or a combo box. If there is more than one column, separate the numbers with either a semicolon or the list separator character. List separator characters are defined in the Regional Settings section of Windows Control Panel. |
|2147|You must be in Design view to create or delete controls. |
|2148|The number you used to refer to the form or report section is invalid. Make sure that the number is less than the number of sections in the form or report. |
|2149|The constant you entered for the control type is invalid. For a list of valid constants you can use to create a control, click Help. |
|2150|This type of control can't contain other controls. |
|2151|The parent control can't contain the type of control you selected. For example, you used the CreateControl function to designate an option group as the parent of a text box. |
|2152|You can set group levels for reports only, not for forms. |
|2153|You can't specify more than 10 group levels. |
|2154|You can't call this function when the Group, Sort, and Total Pane is open. |
|2157|The sum of the top margin, the bottom margin, the height of the page header, and the height of the page footer is greater than the length of the page you are printing on. |
|2158|You can use the Print method and the report graphics methods (Circle, Line, PSet, and Scale) only in an event procedure or a macro set to the OnPrint, the OnFormat, or the OnPage event property. |
|2159|There isn't enough memory to initialize the Print method or one of the report graphics methods (Circle, Line, PSet, Scale). Close unneeded programs and try again to print or preview the report. For more information on freeing memory, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'memory, troubleshooting'. |
|2160|Microsoft Access couldn't create the graphic or text. An error occurred while initializing the Print method or one of the report graphics methods (Circle, Line, PSet, Scale). Close unneeded programs and try again to print or preview the report. For information on freeing memory, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'memory, troubleshooting'.  |
|2161|The text or expression you entered doesn't match the type of data you are searching for. Redefine the text or expression, or search in a different field. |
|2162|A macro set to one of the current field's properties failed because of an error in a FindRecord action argument. In the Macro window, change the Search As Formatted argument to Yes. If you want the argument setting to remain No, do all of the following: * Select No for the Match Case argument. * Select Yes for the Only Current Field argument. * Make sure you are searching in a bound control. |
|2163|The page number you used as an argument for the GoToPage action or method doesn't exist in this form. |
|2164|You can't disable a control while it has the focus. |
|2165|You can't hide a control that has the focus. |
|2166|You can't lock a control while it has unsaved changes. |
|2167|This property is read-only and can't be modified. |
|2169|You can't save this record at this time. Microsoft Access may have encountered an error while trying to save a record. If you close this object now, the data changes you made will be lost. Do you want to close the database object anyway? |
|2170|There isn't enough memory to retrieve data for the list box. Close unneeded programs. Then close and reopen the active form, and click the list box again. For more information on freeing memory, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'memory, troubleshooting'. |
|2171|You can't have more than seven nested subforms in a main form. Remove the eigth nested subform. |
|2172|You can't use a pass-through query or a non-fixed-column crosstab query as a record source for a subform or subreport. Before you bind the subform or subreport to a crosstab query, set the query's ColumnHeadings property. |
|2173|The control '_' the macro is attempting to search can't be searched. Try one of the following: * Add a GoToControl action before the FindRecord action. * For the FindRecord action, change the Only Current Field action argument from Yes to No. * Change the focus to a searchable control. |

To turn on the Show System Objects option, click Options on the Tools menu, click the View tab, and select the System Objects check box.  |
|2317|The database '_1' can't be repaired or isn't a Microsoft Access database file. |
|2320|Microsoft Access can't display the field for which you entered Where in the Total row. Clear the Show check box for that field. If you want this field to appear in the query's results, add it to the design grid twice. For the field that will appear in the query's results, don't specify Where in the Total row, and make sure the Show check box is checked. |
|2321|You can't set criteria before you add a field or expression to the Field row. Either add a field from the field list to the column and enter an expression, or delete the criteria. |
|2322|You can't sort on the asterisk (*). Because the asterisk represents all fields in the underlying table or query, you can't sort on it. Add the asterisk to the query design grid, along with the specific fields you want to sort on. Clear the Show check box for the sorting fields, and then specify a sort order.  |
|2323|You can't specify criteria for the asterisk (*). Because the asterisk represents all the fields in the underlying table or query, you can't specify criteria for it. Add the asterisk to the query design grid, along with the field(s) you want to set criteria for, and then enter criteria for the specific fields. In the query design grid, clear the Show check box for the criteria field(s), before you run the query.  |
|2324|You can't calculate totals on the asterisk (*). Because the asterisk represents all the fields in the table, you can't calculate totals on it. Remove the asterisk from the query design grid. Add the fields you want to use to the design grid, and then select the total you want to calculate for specific fields.  |
|2325|The field name you entered exceeds the 64-character limit of the LinkMasterFields property. When you use the Relationships command (on the Database Tools tab, click Relationships) to define a relationship between the tables underlying a form and subform, Microsoft Access links the form and subform automatically and sets the LinkChildFields and LinkMasterFields properties. |
|2326|You can't specify Group By, Expression, or Where in the Total row for this column. Specify an aggregate function, such as Sum or Count, for the field or expression you designate as the Value in the crosstab query. For more information on aggregate functions, click Help. |
|2327|You must enter Group By in the Total row for a field that has Column Heading in the Crosstab row. The values derived from the field or expression that you designate as the Column Heading are used to group data in the crosstab query. |
|2328|You can't run an update query on the asterisk (*). Because the asterisk represents all the fields in the table, you can't update it. Remove the asterisk from the query design grid. Add the fields you want to update to the design grid.  |
|2329|To create a crosstab query, you must specify one or more Row Heading(s) options, one Column Heading option, and one Value option. |
|2330|Microsoft Access can't represent the join expression _1 in Design view. * One or more fields may have been deleted or renamed. * The name of one or more fields or tables specified in the join expression may be misspelled. * The join may use an operator that isn't supported in Design view, such as > or <. |
|2331|You must enter Group By in the Total row for at least one of the Row Heading options you enter in the Crosstab row. |
|2332|Microsoft Access can't match the fields you added using the asterisk (*) in the append query. Because the asterisk represents all the fields in the underlying table or query, you can't append an asterisk to one field or expression, and you can't append a single field or expression to an asterisk. Append an asterisk to an asterisk (for example, a table to a table), or append specific fields.  |
|2333|You must enter the name of the table you are creating or appending records to. You tried to define a make-table or append query without specifying a destination table. |
|2334|Microsoft Access can't print '_1' because it is an action query. Because action queries don't produce a recordset, you can't print a Datasheet view of them. Note that an exclamation point (!) joined to a query icon in the Navigation Pane marks an action query. To print a Datasheet view of the records that will be selected by the query, display the query in Design view, click the Datasheet button, and then click the Print button.  |
|2335|You must specify the same number of fields when you set the LinkChildFields and LinkMasterFields properties. You entered a different number of fields for one property than you did for the other. If you use the Relationships command (on the Database Tools tab, click Relationships) to define a relationship between the tables underlying the form and subform, Microsoft Access will link the form and subform automatically and then set the LinkChildFields and LinkMasterFields properties. |
|2337|You can't specify criteria on the same field for which you entered Value in the Crosstab row. You tried to display a crosstab query after entering Value in the Crosstab row and criteria in the Criteria row. If you want this field to supply the cross-tabulated values in the crosstab query, delete the entry in the Criteria row. If you want this to be a criteria field, leave the Crosstab row blank.  |
|2338|Microsoft Access truncated the expression you entered. The expression '_1' exceeds the 1,024-character limit for the query design grid. |
|2339|Microsoft Access can't create a temporary link. You reached the limit for the number of links in your database. Microsoft Access needs to create a temporary link in order to import your ODBC table. Remove all unneeded links or tables.  |
|2340|The expression you entered exceeds the 1,024-character limit for the query design grid. |
|2342|A RunSQL action requires an argument consisting of an SQL statement. For example, an action query that appends records starts with INSERT INTO. A data-definition query that creates a table starts with CREATE TABLE. |
|2343|The value you entered exceeds the Alias property's 64-character limit. |
|2344|For the TopValues property in the query property sheet, you must enter an integer greater than zero. |
|2345|For the TopValues property in the query property sheet, you must enter a percentage from 1 through 100. |
|2346|For the TopValues property in the query property sheet, you must enter a number greater than zero. |
|2347|Microsoft Access can't find the file name you entered for the DestinationDB property in an action query's property sheet. You may have misspelled the database file name, or the file may have been deleted or renamed. |
|2348|You can't leave the Alias property blank. |
|2349|For the TopValues property in the query property sheet, you must enter a number smaller than 2,147,483,647. |
|2350|Microsoft Access can't save the query. * The query is a pass-through query and can't be represented as a simple SQL string. Save the query as a named query from the Query Builder. When you close the Query Builder, Microsoft Access will fill the RecordSource or RowSource property with the saved query name. * Make sure the query doesn't have an SQL syntax error. |
|2351|Microsoft Access can't represent an implicit VALUES clause in the query design grid. Edit this in SQL view. |
|2352|You can't modify this query because it has been deleted or renamed by another user. |
|2353|Bad query parameter '_'. |
|2354|This query or table has an expression that is failing to evaluate.|
|2355|You can select up to _ values in a column filter for a multi-valued field. Remove some values, and then try again.|
|2356|You cannot assign a multivalued or Attachment field to the Link Master Fields or Link Child Fields properties. |
|2360|A field name is missing. You have defined a data type or a description for a field without specifying the field name. Enter a name for the field, or delete the row.  |
|2361|Microsoft Access can't save this table. There are no fields in this table. Define at least one field by entering a field name and selecting a data type.  |
|2362|You already have a field named '_â€™. |
|2363|Microsoft Access allows only one AutoNumber field per table. Use the Number data type for similar fields. |

|2366|Microsoft Access was unable to save the field ordering. All other changes were saved successfully. Click the File tab, point to Manage, and then click Compact and Repair Database. |
|2370|Removing or changing the index for this field would require removal of the primary key. If you want to delete the primary key, select that field and click the Primary Key button. |
|2371|Microsoft Access can't create a primary key. Your changes weren't saved. |
|2372|The field name you entered does not follow Microsoft Access object-naming rules. If you pasted the name from another application, try pressing ESC and typing the name again. For more information about naming objects, click Help. |
|2373|The setting for the FieldSize property must be from 0 through 255. |
|2374|You can't create an index or primary key on more than 10 fields. |
|2375|You can't paste beyond the end of a table. You have attempted to paste fields beyond the 255th row in a table in Design view. |
|2376|Microsoft Access can't create a primary key. You have selected too many fields for a multiple-field primary key. |
|2377|Once you enter data in a table, you can't change the data type of any field to AutoNumber, even if you haven't yet added data to that field. Add a new field to the table, and define its data type as AutoNumber. Microsoft Access then enters data in the AutoNumber field automatically, numbering the records consecutively starting with 1. |
|2378|This table is read-only. Use a different name in the Save As dialog box to save your changes. |
|2379|You can't create a primary key on a field of this data type. You can't define a primary key on fields with an OLE Object, Memo, Attachment, or Multi-valued lookup field. |
|2380|Microsoft Access can't create a primary key because no fields have been selected. You have selected a row with no fields defined. Place the insertion point somewhere in the row of the field you want to define as the primary key.  |
|2381|Microsoft Access can't create a primary key because the field doesn't have a name. Name the field, and then define it as a primary key field. |
|2382|You can't switch to Datasheet view and you can't return to Design view. Another user has opened this table or a query, form, or report that is bound to this table. |
|2383|Microsoft Access can't change the data type. There isn't enough disk space or memory. |
|2384|You cannot change one field from an AutoNumber data type and add another AutoNumber field at the same time. Do the following: 1. Delete the AutoNumber field you just added, click the File tab, and then click Save. 2.  Add the new AutoNumber field, and then save the table again. |
|2385|Errors were encountered during the save operation. |

|2427|You entered an expression that has no value. The expression may refer to an object that has no value, such as a form, a report, or a label control. |
|2428|You entered an invalid argument in a domain aggregate function. * A field in the string expression may not be in the domain. * A field specified in the criteria expression may not be in the domain. |
|2429|The In operator you entered requires parentheses. |
|2430|You did not enter the keyword And in the Between...And operator. The correct syntax is as follows: expression [Not] Between value1 And value2|
|2431|The expression you entered contains invalid syntax. You may have entered a comma without a preceding value or identifier. |
|2432|The expression you entered contains invalid syntax, or you need to enclose your text data in quotes. You may have entered an invalid comma or omitted quotation marks. For example, if the Default Value property of a text field is ''Huey, Louie, and Dewey,'' it must be enclosed in quotes if you mean it as a literal text string. This avoids the confusion with the expression ''Huey Louie'' And ''Dewey''. |

|2439|The expression you entered has a function containing the wrong number of arguments. |
|2440|You must enclose IIf function arguments in parentheses. |
|2442|The expression you entered has invalid parentheses. You may have used the parenthesis syntax for an identifier in a query. Use the standard identifier syntax: Forms![Form]![Control]. |
|2443|You can use the Is operator only in an expression with Null or Not Null. |
|2445|The expression you entered is too complex. |
|2446|There isn't enough memory available to perform this calculation. Close unneeded programs, and try again. For more information on freeing memory, search the Microsoft Windows Help index for 'memory, troubleshooting'. |
|2447|There is an invalid use of the . (dot) or ! operator or invalid parentheses. You may have entered an invalid identifier or typed parentheses following the Null constant. |
|2448|You can't assign a value to this object. * The object may be a control on a read-only form. * The object may be on a form that is open in Design view. * The value may be too large for this field. |
|2449|There is an invalid method in an expression. For example, you may have tried to use the Print method with an object other than Report or Debug. |
|2450|Microsoft Access cannot find the referenced form '_1'. * The form you referenced may be closed or may not exist in this database.* Microsoft Access may have encountered a compile error in a Visual Basic module for the form. |
|2451|The report name '_' you entered is misspelled or refers to a report that isn't open or doesn't exist. |
|2452|The expression you entered has an invalid reference to the Parent property. For example, you may be using the Parent property with a control on a main form or report rather than with a control on a subform or subreport. |
|2453|The control name '_' you entered in your expression is misspelled or refers to a control on a form or report that isn't open or doesn't exist. |
|2454|The object name '_' you entered following the ! operator in the expression is invalid. For example, you may have tried to enter an identifier with two control names separated by the ! operator. |
|2455|You entered an expression that has an invalid reference to the property _. The property may not exist or may not apply to the object you specified. |
|2456|The number you used to refer to the form is invalid. Use the Count property to count the open forms and make sure that the form number is not greater than the number of open forms minus one. |
|2457|The number you used to refer to the report is invalid. Use the Count property to count the open reports and make sure that the report number is not greater than the number of open reports. |
|2458|The control number you specified is greater than the number of controls. Use the Count property to count the controls on the form or report and then check that the control number you cite is within the range of existing controls. |
|2459|You can't refer to the Parent property of a form or report when either is open in Design view. |
|2460|You can't refer to the RecordsetClone property of a form open in Design view. |

|2463|Use a number, not a string, to refer to a group level. |
|2464|There is no sorting or grouping field or expression defined for the group level number you used. A valid group level number can be from 0 (for the first field or expression you sort or group on) through 9 (for the tenth). Count the group levels in the report starting with zero. |
|2465|Microsoft Access can't find the field '_1' referred to in your expression. You may have misspelled the field name, or the field may have been renamed or deleted. |
|2466|The expression you entered has an invalid reference to the Dynaset property. For example, you may have used the Dynaset property with a form that isn't based on a table or query. |
|2467|The expression you entered refers to an object that is closed or doesn't exist. For example, you may have assigned a form to a Form object variable, closed the form, and then referred to the object variable. |
|2468|The value you entered for the interval, number, or date argument in the function is invalid. Check the argument to make sure that you entered it correctly. For more information on valid argument values, search the Help index for 'DatePart function,' 'DateAdd function,' or 'DateDiff function'. |
|2469|The expression _2 you entered in the form control's ValidationRule property contains the error _1. Microsoft Access can't parse the ValidationRule expression you entered. For example, if you enter the expression =MyFunction() in the ValidationRule property, and the function MyFunction doesn't exist, Microsoft Access displays the following message: Unknown function name in validation rule: 'MyFunction'. To help you create expressions as arguments in Visual Basic, use the Expression Builder. For more information, search the Help index for 'Expression Builder'.  |
|2470|There is a(n) '_' in the form control's ValidationRule property. To help you create expressions as arguments in Visual Basic, use the Expression Builder. For more information, search the Help index for 'Expression Builder'. |
|2471|The expression you entered as a query parameter produced this error: '_'|
|2472|The LinkMasterFields property setting has produced this error: '_'|
|2473|The expression _2 you entered as the event property setting produced the following error: _1. * The expression may not result in the name of a macro, the name of a user-defined function, or [Event Procedure]. * There may have been an error evaluating the function, event, or macro. |
|2474|The expression you entered requires the control to be in the active window. Try one of the following: * Open or select a form or report containing the control. * Create a new control in the active window, and try the operation again. |
|2475|You entered an expression that requires a form to be the active window. |
|2476|You entered an expression that requires a report to be the active window. |
|2477|You entered an invalid objecttype value '_' in an If TypeOf object Is objecttype condition of an If...Then...Else statement. The objecttype can be any one of the following: BoundObjectFrame, CheckBox, ComboBox, CommandButton, Label, Line, ListBox, UnboundObjectFrame, OptionButton, OptionGroup, PageBreak, Rectangle, Subform, Subreport, TextBox, ToggleButton, ImageControl, or OLEControl. |
|2478|Microsoft Access doesn't allow you to use this method in the current view. Most methods, including the SetFocus and Requery methods, can't be used in form or report Design view. |
|2479|The event procedure '_' can't be a Function procedure; it must be a Sub procedure. If you want to run a Function procedure when an event occurs, try one of the following: * Set the event property to the name of a macro containing a RunCode action that runs the Function procedure. * Set the event property to =FunctionName(). |
|2480|You referred to a property by a numeric argument that isn't one of the property numbers in the collection. Check the property numbers in the collection. |
|2481|You can't set a value while a document is in Print Preview. |
|2482|Microsoft Access cannot find the name '_1' you entered in the expression. You may have specified a control that wasn't on the current object without specifying the correct form or report context. To refer to a control on another form or report, precede the control name with the name of a collection. This is usually either Forms or Reports, and the name of the form or report to which the control belongs. For example, Forms![Products]![Units In Stock].  |
|2483|You can't move to a previous control when only one control has had the focus. Use the PreviousControl property only after you've moved the focus to a second control. |
|2484|There is no active datasheet. |
|2485|Microsoft Access cannot find the object '_1â€™. If '_1' is a new macro or macro group, make sure you have saved it and that you have typed its name correctly. |
|2486|You can't carry out this action at the present time. You tried to run a macro or used the DoCmd object in Visual Basic to carry out an action. However, Microsoft Access is performing another activity that prevents this action from being carried out now. For example, no actions on a form can be carried out while Microsoft Access is repainting a control or calculating an expression. Carry out the action later.  |
|2487|The Object Type argument for the action or method is blank or invalid. * For a Close, GoToRecord, SearchForRecord or RepaintObject action, enter values for both arguments, or leave both blank to perform the action on the active object. * For a DeleteObject, Rename, or CopyObject action, enter values for both arguments, or leave both blank to perform the action on the object currently selected in the Navigation Pane. * For a SendObject or OutputTo action, enter values for both arguments, or leave the Object Name argument blank if you want the action performed on the active object of the specified object type. * If you're using a method with the DoCmd object, use an intrinsic constant that equates to a valid object type or the corresponding numeric value for the argument name. |
|2488|You can't use the ApplyFilter action on this window. * You tried to use the ApplyFilter action or method, but you didn't apply the filter to a table, query, form, or report. * You may have applied the filter to a form, but the form wasn't open in Form or Datasheet view. * You may have applied the filter to a report but didn't use the ApplyFilter action in a macro specified by the OnOpen property setting. Use the SelectObject action or method to select the table, query, form, or report before applying the filter.  |
|2489|The object '_' isn't open. * The macro you are running (directly or indirectly) contains a GoToRecord, RepaintObject, or SelectObject action, but the Object Name argument names an object that is closed. * The objectname argument for the GoToRecord, RepaintObject, or SelectObject method names an object that is closed. Use one of the Open actions or methods to open the object so that you can carry out the desired action.  |
|2491|The action or method is invalid because the form or report isn't bound to a table or query. You tried to use the ApplyFilter or SearchForRecord action or method. However, the form or report you applied the filter to is not based on a table or query, so the form or report doesn't have any records to apply a filter to. Use the SelectObject action or method to select the desired form or report before you run the ApplyFilter action. To base a form or report on a table or query, open the form or report in Design view, and enter the table or query name in the RecordSource property.  |
|2492|Microsoft Access can't find the macro '_2' in the macro group '_1â€™. You used the macrogroupname.macroname syntax to specify a macro. You then tried to run the macro (directly or indirectly), or you used the RunMacro method to run the macro. However, the macro you specified isn't in this macro group. Create the macro in the macro group, specify the correct macro group, or specify the correct macro name.  |
|2493|This action requires an Object Name argument. |
|2494|The action or method requires a Form Name argument. You tried to use the OpenForm action or method, but you left the Form Name argument blank. In the Form Name argument, enter the name of a form in the current database.  |
|2495|The action or method requires a Table Name argument. You tried to use the OpenTable, TransferSpreadsheet, or TransferText action or method, but you left the Table Name argument blank. In the Table Name argument, enter the name of a table that is in the current database.  |
|2496|The action or method requires a Query Name argument. You tried to use the OpenQuery action or method, but you left the Query Name argument blank. In the Query Name argument, enter a query name.  |
|2497|The action or method requires a Report Name argument. You tried to use the OpenReport action or method, but you left the Report Name argument blank. In the Report Name argument, enter the name of a report.  |
|2498|An expression you entered is the wrong data type for one of the arguments. You tried to run a macro or use a method to carry out an action, but an expression evaluated to the wrong data type. For example, for the Close method you specified a string for the Object Type argument, but this argument can be set only to certain intrinsic constants or their numeric equivalents. |
|2499|You can't use the GoToRecord or SearchForRecord action or method on an object in Design view. Try one of the following: * Switch to Form or Datasheet view for a form. * Switch to Datasheet view for a query or table. * If you are running a macro or Visual Basic procedure containing an action that opens the object, set the View argument to the correct view before you carry out the GoToRecord action. |
|2500|You must enter a number greater than zero for a Repeat Count argument. You tried to use the RunMacro action or method, but you entered a value less than zero (or an expression that evaluates to less than zero) in the Repeat Count argument. To run the macro once, leave this argument blank.  |
|2501|The _ action was canceled. You used a method of the DoCmd object to carry out an action in Visual Basic, but then clicked Cancel in a dialog box. For example, you used the Close method to close a changed form, then clicked Cancel in the dialog box that asks if you want to save the changes you made to the form. |
|2502|The action or method requires a Macro Name argument. * You tried to use the RunMacro action or method, but you left the Macro Name argument blank. * Microsoft Access tried to create a custom menu bar for a form or report, but the Menu Macro Name argument of the AddMenu action is blank. In the Menu Macro Name argument, enter the name of a macro or macro group that is in the current database.  |
|2503|You can't use this action with the DoCmd object. For a list of the actions that the DoCmd object doesn't support and some alternatives to using these actions, click Help. Any actions that aren't in this list can be used with the DoCmd object. |
|2504|The action or method requires at least _ argument(s). You tried to run a macro containing an action or used a method or action with the DoCmd object, but you didn't set the required number of arguments. For example, if you use the MoveSize action, you must set at least one of the four arguments. |
|2505|An expression in argument _ has an invalid value. You tried to run a macro or used the DoCmd object in Visual Basic. The argument number above is the position of the argument as it appears in the Macro window, the Action Failed dialog box, or the Object Browser (if you're using the DoCmd object). Try one of the following: * Select a setting from the drop-down list box in each argument. * Use an intrinsic constant equating to a valid object type. * Substitute the correct corresponding expression.  |
|2506|A value you entered for the Transfer Type argument is invalid. An expression in the Transfer Type argument doesn't evaluate to a valid numeric value. Valid values for the Transfer Type argument are as follows: * 0, 1, and 2 for the TransferDatabase action. * 0, 1, and 2 for the TransferSpreadsheet action. * 0 through 6 for the TransferText action.  |
|2507|The _ type isn't an installed database type or doesn't support the operation you chose. You used the TransferDatabase method, but an expression in the databasetype argument doesn't evaluate to a valid database type for importing, exporting, or linking. For information on valid database types, click Help. |
|2508|A value you entered for the spreadsheettype argument is invalid. You used the TransferSpreadsheet method, and an expression in the spreadsheettype argument doesn't evaluate to a valid numeric value. Valid values are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Note that 1 is an invalid value; you can't import or export to a Lotus .wks format file.  |
|2509|The setting for the Range argument can't be longer than 255 characters. |
|2510|The expression you entered in the Specification Name argument exceeds the 64-character limit. Select one of the existing specification names from the argument list box when you use the TransferText action in a macro, or enter a name in Visual Basic that follows Microsoft Access object-naming rules. |
|2511|The action or method requires a Specification Name argument. You tried to use the TransferText action or method and you specified a Transfer Type argument but left the Specification Name argument blank. In the Specification Name argument, enter an existing specification name from the argument list box.  |
|2512|Microsoft Access cannot parse the expression: '_1'. Click OK to return to the action argument or conditional expression where this expression appears, and then correct the syntax. |
|2513|The Macro Name argument can't be longer than 64 characters according to Microsoft Access object-naming rules. |
|2514|The action or method requires a Control Name argument. You tried to use the GoToControl action or method, but you left the control name blank. In the Control Name argument, enter a control or field name from the active form or datasheet.  |
|2515|Microsoft Access cannot open the macro '_1' because it was saved using a different version of Microsoft Access. Re-create the macro in the current version of Microsoft Access. |
|2516|Microsoft Access cannot find the module '_1â€™. You tried to use the OpenModule action or method, but Microsoft Access can't find the module you specified in the Module Name argument. Enter a valid module name from the current database.  |
|2517|Microsoft Access cannot find the procedure '_1â€™. * You may have used the Run method in Visual Basic but entered an invalid procedure name, or you used the Run method without first opening a database. * You tried to use the OpenModule action or method, but you used an invalid procedure name. |
|2520|The action or method requires a Module or Procedure Name argument. You tried to use the OpenModule action or method, but you didn't enter a name in either the Module Name or the Procedure Name argument in the Macro window. Enter a valid name in one of these arguments.  |
|2521|You have specified a Transfer Type that doesn't support the HTML Table Name argument. Leave the HTML Table Name argument blank unless you are using the Import HTML or Link HTML Transfer Types. |
|2522|The action or method requires a File Name argument. You tried to use the TransferSpreadsheet or TransferText action or method. In the File Name argument, enter a file name.  |
|2523|The value you entered for the show argument is invalid. You used the ShowToolbar method. Valid values for this argument are acToolbarYes, acToolbarWhereApprop, and acToolbarNo, or the corresponding numeric values 0, 1, and 2.  |
|2524|Microsoft Access can't invoke the application using the RunApp action. The path to the application is invalid, or a component of the application is missing. Check the path in Windows Explorer or File Manager.  |
|2525|Macros can only be called 19 times. Your macro contains one or more RunMacro actions that calls a macro more than 19 times. Use an If block to stop the macro after it has been run 19 times.  |
|2526|The SendKeys action requires the Microsoft Access Utility Add-in to be loaded. Rerun Microsoft Access or Microsoft Office Setup to reinstall Microsoft Access and the Microsoft Access Utility Add-in. |
|2527|Lotus .wks file formats aren't supported in the current version of Microsoft Access. Convert your .wks file to a more recent format, such as .wk1. |
|2528|The RunCommand macro action argument is missing, or you entered an invalid command ID for the RunCommand method. |
|2529|The Toolbar argument can't be longer than 64 characters. |
|2530|The SelectObject method can't be used on a report that is currently printing. |
|2531|Your HTML file does not contain any tabular data that Microsoft Access can import. . |
|2532|Microsoft Access cannot find the macro or sub procedure '_1â€™. The specified macro, macro group, or sub procedure doesn't exist.  Note that when you enter the macrogroupname.macroname syntax in an argument, you must specify the name the macro's macro group was last saved under. Also, ensure that the referenced macro has been saved, or that the referenced sub procedure expects 0 arguments.  |
|2533|The ApplyFilter action requires that either the Filter Name or Where Condition argument is set. You tried to run a macro containing an ApplyFilter action, but you didn't set the required arguments. |
|2534|The action or method requires a data access page Name argument. You tried to use the OpenDataAccessPage action or method, but you left the data access page Name argument blank. In the data access page Name argument, enter the name of a data access page in the current database.  |
|2535|The ApplyFilter action contains a Filter Name that cannot be applied. The filter name is not a valid argument in the ApplyFilter action in Client Server. |
|2537|The feature '_' is not available while the database is opened in disabled mode. |
|2538|The '_' macro action cannot be run in disabled mode. |
|2539|The Name argument of the SetLocalVar macro action is a reserved name. Please change the name argument of the SetLocalVar action.|
|2540|The file '_1' you tried to replace is a Microsoft Access system file that is being used and can't be replaced or deleted. |
|2541|The contents of the Clipboard have been deleted and can't be pasted. Some applications do not put large objects on the Clipboard. Instead, they put a pointer to the object on the Clipboard. The pointer may vanish before the paste happens. |
|2542|Specify the database name in the command line so that Microsoft Access can find the macro. |
|2543|You can't paste a database object onto itself. |
|2544|Microsoft Access cannot find the _1 you referenced in the Object Name argument. The macro you tried to run includes a SelectObject action with an invalid name for the Object Name argument. In the Navigation Pane, verify the name of the object you want the macro to select. Then open the macro in the Macro window and enter the correct name for the Object Name argument.  |
|2545|The CopyObject action requires you to specify a different destination database or a new name to copy from the current database. The macro you are running includes a CopyObject action. Open the macro in the Macro window, and select the CopyObject action. Enter a destination database or a new name in the appropriate argument box.  |
|2546|Select a database object in the Navigation Pane before you run the macro containing the _ action. |
|2547|The database '_' you tried to delete and replace is read-only and can't be deleted or replaced. Enter a different name for the new database. |
|2548|Microsoft Access can't run the Security Wizard because this database is open in exclusive mode. Do you want Microsoft Access to open the database in shared mode and run the Security Wizard? |
|2549|Microsoft Access can't delete _1 after compacting it. The compacted database has been named _2. If you compact a database using the same name, Microsoft Access creates a new compacted database and then deletes the original database. In this case, however, the original database wasn't deleted because it is read-only. If you can, remove the read-only status, delete the original database, and then rename the new database using the original name. If you can't remove the read-only status, inform your workgroup administrator.  |
|2550|Microsoft Access can't delete _1 after encoding it. The encoded database has been named _2. If you encode a database using the same name, Microsoft Access creates a new encoded database, and then deletes the original database. In this case, however, the original database can't be deleted because it is read-only. If you can, remove the read-only status, delete the original database, and then rename the new database using the original name. If you can't remove the read-only status, inform your workgroup administrator.  |
|2551|Microsoft Access can't delete _1 after decoding it. The decoded database has been named _2. If you decode a database using the same name, Microsoft Access creates a new decoded database, and then deletes the original database. In this case, however, the original database can't be deleted because it is read-only. If you can, remove the read-only status, delete the original database, and then rename the new database using the original name. If you can't remove the read-only status, inform your workgroup administrator.  |
|2552|You can't encode a database that you didn't create or don't own. See the owner of the database or your workgroup administrator. |
|2553|You can't decode a database that you didn't create or don't own. See the owner of the database or your workgroup administrator. |
|2554|Can't find the database you specified, or you didn't specify a database at all. Specify a valid database name in the command line, and include a path if necessary. |
|2556|Microsoft Access can't run the Security Wizard because the database uses a password. Remove the database password by clicking Unset Database Password in the Database Tools group on the Database Tools tab. |
|2557|The database you tried to convert was either created in or was already converted to the requested version of Microsoft Access. |
|2559|Microsoft Access was unable to refresh the linked table '_1' in database '_2' during conversion. Try to refresh the links manually by using the Linked Table Manager command in the Database Tools group on the Database Tools tab.|
|2560|Microsoft Access is unable to load the Database Properties. |
|2561|Microsoft Access can't display the Database Properties dialog box. |
|2562|Microsoft Access is unable to save the Database Properties. |
|2564|You can't hide the document '_' while it is open. Close the database object first, and then hide it. |
|2565|You can't unhide the database object '_' while it is open. Close the database object first, and then unhide it. |
|2566|Microsoft Access is unable to set the application's icon to the file '_1'. Make sure the file is a valid icon (.ico) file. If you're using Microsoft Windows, you can also use .bmp files. |
|2567|Microsoft Access can't open or convert this previous version database. The database was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Access. You don't have appropriate security permissions to open or convert databases created in earlier versions. |
|2568|Microsoft Access can't undo this operation. An object with the same name already exists. Another user might have created an object named '_' after you had performed this operation on an object with the same name. |
|2571|You cannot modify objects created in an earlier version of Microsoft Access. To convert this database to the current version of Microsoft Access, close the database, click the File tabn, and then click Convert. |
|2572|This database is in an unexpected state and Microsoft Access cannot open it. This database has been converted from a prior version of Microsoft Access by using the DAO CompactDatabase method instead of the Convert Database command (click the File tab and then click Convert). Converting by using the DAO CompactDatabase method has left the database in a partially converted state. If you have a copy of the database in its original format, click the File tab and then click Convert to convert it. If the original database is no longer available, create a new database and import your tables and queries to preserve your data and try again. Your other database objects cannot be recovered.  |
|2573|This database is a replica created in a different version of Access.  You can only convert this replica by synchronizing with its Design Master. Convert the Design Master of this replica set then synchronize the replica with the Design Master.|
|2574|You can't create another Microsoft Access database with the same name and location as an existing database. You carried out the Make MDE File command, but tried to give the new database the same extension as the old one. Accept the default .mde extension for your new MDE database.  |
|2575|You can't create a Microsoft Access MDE database from a database replica. |
|2576|This database is a Microsoft Access 7.0/8.0/9.0 Design Master/Replica. If you click OK, the database you selected will be renamed to _1 and then converted to _2. Everyone using a replica of this database will have to upgrade to Microsoft Access 2000 after the next synchronization. |
|2577|The database _ is already open. Close the database before carrying out the Make MDE File command. |
|2578|Microsoft Access was unable to create the .accde, .mde, or .ade file. |
|2579|Local forms, reports, macros, and modules in this replica will not be converted.  To retain these objects, please be sure to import them into the Design Master from the original replica.|
|2580|The record source '_' specified on this form or report does not exist.

Then create an unbound text box in the page header or footer. If you are running a macro, use the SetValue action to set the unbound text box value to the value in the hidden control.  |
|2585|This action can't be carried out while processing a form or report event. A macro specified as the OnOpen, OnLoad, OnClose, OnFormat, OnRetreat, OnPage, or OnPrint property setting contains an invalid action for the property. When you click OK, an Action Failed dialog box will display the name of the macro that failed and its arguments.  |
|2586|Microsoft Access changed the MoveLayout and NextRecord properties to True from False. The macro or Visual Basic function run by the OnFormat property of one of the sections of the report set both the MoveLayout and NextRecord properties to False. Having both properties set to False can make the report print continuously. Revise the macro or function so that it sets these properties to the values you want.  |
|2587|Microsoft Access can't complete the Output operation. The Visual Basic code you entered contains a syntax error or the Output procedures are not available.

|2794|The ActiveX control you tried to insert isn't registered. For information on registering an ActiveX control, click Help. |
|2797|This OLE object was created in an earlier version of OLE so it can't be displayed as an icon. For an effect similar to displaying an object as an icon, add an image control to your form, and add the icon for the application to the image control. Then set the image control's OnDblClick property to a Visual Basic procedure that opens the OLE object. |
|2798|You can't use the Action property to delete a bound OLE object from its underlying table or query. You tried to run a Visual Basic procedure that deletes the object in a bound object frame by setting the Action property to acOLEDelete. Delete the object in a different way, such as with the DAO Delete method in Visual Basic.  |
|2799|The OLE object can't be activated upon receiving the focus. If you selected an OLE object or a chart, and the AutoActivate property for that control is set to GetFocus, the OLE object or chart should be activated automatically when it receives the focus. However, the ActiveX component doesn't support this operation. Check the component's documentation for information on the properties and methods it makes available to Automation operations.  |
|2800|This object is locked. Any changes you make will be discarded when the form is closed. Click the File tab, point to Save As, and save the object under a different name. |
|2801|The OLE object isn't loaded because the unbound ActiveX control hasn't been initialized. |
|2802|You can't insert an ActiveX control in a bound or unbound object frame. ActiveX controls are automatically contained in ActiveX control frames. |
|2803|You don't have the license required to use this ActiveX control. You tried to open a form containing an OLE object or an ActiveX control or you tried to create an ActiveX control. To obtain the appropriate license, contact the company that provides the licensed OLE object or ActiveX control.  |
|2804|You can't create an ActiveX control in an unbound object frame. ActiveX controls are automatically contained in ActiveX control frames. |
|2805|There was an error loading an ActiveX control on one of your forms or reports. Make sure all the controls that you are using are properly registered. For information on registering an ActiveX control, click Help. |
|2806|Microsoft Access doesn't support this ActiveX control. |
|2807|You can't paste this object as the type you specified. Choose another object type. |

|7701|Microsoft Access can't synchronize with Synchronizer '_1â€™. A possible reason for the failure to synchronize with '_1' is that both the Synchronizer and Microsoft Access were trying to write to the current database at the same time. Try synchronizing with '_1' again. Do you want to continue synchronizing with the remaining Synchronizers? |
|7702|The user-supplied function named '_', the program to assist you in resolving conflicts, could not be found. Contact the author of this customized database application. |

|7708|'_1' was the last designated Design Master for the replica set. Has '_2' been moved, renamed, deleted, or corrupted?  You should never have more than one Design Master for each replica set. Having more than one Design Master in a replica set prevents the members of the set from synchronizing correctly. Use Windows Explorer to determine whether the file has been moved or deleted. Open the file to determine whether it has been corrupted.|
|7709|To make this replica the Design Master for the replica set, on the Database Tools tab, in the Database Tools group, click Replication Options, click Synchronize Now, enter the path to '_' (the current Design Master), and then select the Make ... The Design Master check box. |
|7710|To make this replica the Design Master for the replica set, first synchronize this replica with all other replicas in the set. This ensures that this replica includes all design changes made at the previous Design Master. If you have already synchronized this replica, do you want to make it the Design Master? |
|7711|This member of the replica set is now the Design Master. Microsoft Access will now close and reopen the database in order for the changes to take effect. |
|7712|This member of the replica set has exceeded the maximum number of days allowed between synchronizations and can't be synchronized with any other member of the replica set. Delete this replica set member and create a new replica. |
|7713|This member of the replica set will expire in _ days because it has not been synchronized with another member of the replica set. If the member is allowed to expire, it can no longer be synchronized with any other member of the replica set. You should synchronize this member with another member as soon as possible. To synchronize, on the the Database Tools tab, in the Database Tools group, click Replication Options, and then click Synchronize Now.  |
|7714|Microsoft Access cannot close the database at this time. Make sure there is no Visual Basic code executing in the current database. You may need to run Setup again to properly install Briefcase Replication. |

## Form.Error
Here is typical error handler for a subform as a table:

    Public Const cErrCodeValueRequierd = 3162
    Public Const cErrCodeDuplicateKey = 3022

    Private Sub Form_Error(DataErr As Integer, Response As Integer)
        Select Case DataErr
            Case cErrCodeDuplicateKey
                MsgBox "Duplicate records are not allowed!", vbExclamation, "Key violation"
                Response = acDataErrContinue
            Case cErrCodeValueRequired
                MsgBox "Field ""fieldName"" requires data!""
                Response = acDataErrContinue
            Case Else
                MsgBox "Other error. Error code: " & DataErr    
        End Select
    End Sub


## Trap All Errors
Basic error handling should be added to all procedures in production code, since otherwise an unexpected error will cause Access to crash or invite the end-user to enter debug mode. 

A typical pattern for a basic error handler that traps all errors is:  

<!-- language: lang-vb -->
    Sub Name()
    On Error GoTo errHandler
    
    '[some code...]
    
    exitHandler:
        'Clean up any objects
        Exit Sub

    errHandler:
        Select Case Err.Number
            'Any expected error cases go here
        Case Else
            MsgBox Err.Number & Err.Description
        End Select
        Resume exitHandler   'Make sure objects get cleaned up when code threw an error
    End Sub

## Catching and handling errors in user code
On error move to labelled code and see if there is a specific error that needs to be handled.

    Public Const cErrCodeNotNumber = 2262   ' This value must be a number.
    Public Const cErrCodeNumericOverflow = 2263   ' The number is too large.

    Private Sub MySub()
        Dim objConn As ADODB.Connection
        Dim objCmd As ADODB.Command
        Dim objRS As ADODB.Recordset
        'etc.

        On Error Goto ErrHandler
        [...My code goes here...]

    ExitSub:
        'Cleanup
        If objConn.State <> adStateOpen Then objConn.Close 'Closing connection to database, if it is still open
        If Not objRS Is Nothing Then objRS.Close
        objConn = Nothing
        ObjRS = Nothing
        'Do any other cleaning.
        Exit Sub

    ErrHandler:
        Select Case Err.Number
            Case cErrCodeNotNumber
                MsgBox "The value found is not a number. Execution stopped.", vbCritical
            Case cErrCodeNumericOverflow
                MsgBox "The value found is too big. [instructions how to resolve this]", vbCritical
            Case Else
                MsgBox "Error " & Err.Number & ". " & vbCrLf & Err.Source & "--->" & Err.Description, "Unrecoverable error", vbCritical
        End Select
        
        Goto ExitSub
    End Sub
