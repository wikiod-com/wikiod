## Getting Started: Introduction
## Prerequisites

- **Have a strong grasp of a programming language** such as Python, C, C++, Ruby, or any of the other languages out there.
- **Have your favorite code editor or IDE installed** (one such example is [VSCode][1]) 
- **Stay motivated.** Constructing a compiler is not easy, so keep pushing; it's worth the effort.

# Language Categories
> When making a compiler, you need to decide which of 2 types of language the compiler will be.

- **Toy language:** This is when you make a programming language which doesn't fix an issue, but is for learning. Fun examples of these are `Whitespace`, `Lolcode`, and `Brainfuck`.

- **Programming language:** These are the languages which aim to solve a problem or bring something new and unique to the table. These can be compared to languages like `Swift`, `C++`, and `Python`.

# Resources

> During your journey, it is inevitable that you will stumble over something which you have no idea about, but hopefully, one of these resources will aid you.

- [**Create Your Own Programming Language** (Ebook)][2]
    - +Friendly to beginners
    - +Short
    - +Aided the creation of `Coffeescript` and `Rubby`
- [**Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (The Dragon Book)**][3]
    - Contains everything you'd ever want to know about a compiler, but it's advanced and a long read
- [**Modern Compiler Design** (Ebook)][4]
    - This is another highly praised book on compiler design
