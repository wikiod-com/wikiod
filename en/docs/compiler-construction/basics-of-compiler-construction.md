This topic will contain all the basics in compiler construction that you will need to know so that you can get started in making your own compiler. This documentation topic will contain the first `2` out of `4` sections in compiler constructions and the rest will be in a different topic.

The topics which will be covered are:

**Lexical Analysis**

**Parsing**


## Syntax
- **Lexical Analysis** the source text is converted to type and value tokens.

- **Parsing** the source tokens are converted to an abstract syntax tree (AST). 

## Simple Lexical Analyser
> In this example I will show you how to make a basic lexer which will create the tokens for a integer variable declaration in `python`.

# What does the lexical analyser do?

The purpose of a lexer (lexical analyser) is to scan the source code and break up each word into a list item. Once done it takes these words and creates a type and value pair which looks like this `['INTEGER', '178']` to form a token.

These tokens are created in order to identify the syntax for your language so the whole point of the lexer is to create the syntax of your language as it all depends on how you want to identify and interpret different items.

---

Example source code for this lexer:

    int result = 100;

Code for lexer in `python`:
    
    import re                                 # for performing regex expressions

    tokens = []                               # for string tokens
    source_code = 'int result = 100;'.split() # turning source code into list of words
    
    # Loop through each source code word
    for word in source_code:
        
        # This will check if a token has datatype decleration
        if word in ['str', 'int', 'bool']: 
            tokens.append(['DATATYPE', word])
        
        # This will look for an identifier which would be just a word
        elif re.match("[a-z]", word) or re.match("[A-Z]", word):
            tokens.append(['IDENTIFIER', word])
        
        # This will look for an operator
        elif word in '*-/+%=':
            tokens.append(['OPERATOR', word])
        
        #Â This will look for integer items and cast them as a number
        elif re.match(".[0-9]", word):
            if word[len(word) - 1] == ';': 
                tokens.append(["INTEGER", word[:-1]])
                tokens.append(['END_STATEMENT', ';'])
            else: 
                tokens.append(["INTEGER", word])

    print(tokens) # Outputs the token array

When running this code snippet the output should be the following:

    [['DATATYPE', 'int'], ['IDENTIFIER', 'result'], ['OPERATOR', '='], ['INTEGER', '100'], ['END_STATEMENT', ';']]

As you can see all we did is turn a piece of source code such as the integer variable declaration into a token stream of type and value pair tokens.

---

# Let's break it down

1) We begin of by import regex library because it will be needed when checking if certain words match a certain regex pattern.
2. We create an empty list called `tokens`. This will be used to store all of the tokens we create.
3. We split our source code which is a string into a list of words where every word in the string separated by a space is a list item. We then store those in a variable called `source_code`.
4. We start looping through our `source_code` list word by word.
5. We now perform our first check:

       if word in ['str', 'int', 'bool']: 
          tokens.append(['DATATYPE', word])
    
    What we check for here is a datatype which will tell us what type our variable will be.

6. After that we perform more checks like the one above identifying each word in our source code and creating a token for it. These tokens will then be passed on to the parser to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

## Simple Parser
> This is a simple parser which will parse an integer variable declaration token stream which we created in the previous example Simple Lexical Analyser. This parser will also be coded in python.

# What is a parser?

The parser is the process in which the source text is converted to an abstract syntax tree (AST). It is also in charge of performing semantical validation which is weeding out syntactically correct statements that make no sense, e.g. unreachable code or duplicate declarations. 

---

Example tokens:

    [['DATATYPE', 'int'], ['IDENTIFIER', 'result'], ['OPERATOR', '='], ['INTEGER', '100'], ['END_STATEMENT', ';']]

Code for parser in 'python3':

    ast = { 'VariableDecleration': [] }

    tokens = [ ['DATATYPE', 'int'], ['IDENTIFIER', 'result'], ['OPERATOR', '='],  
               ['INTEGER', '100'], ['END_STATEMENT', ';'] ]
               
    # Loop through the tokens and form ast
    for x in range(0, len(tokens)):
        
        # Create variable for type and value for readability
        token_type  = tokens[x][0]
        token_value = tokens[x][1]
        
        # This will check for the end statement which means the end of var decl
        if token_type == 'END_STATEMENT': break
        
        # This will check for the datatype which should be at the first token
        if x == 0 and token_type == 'DATATYPE':
            ast['VariableDecleration'].append( {'type': token_value} )
        
        # This will check for the name which should be at the second token
        if x == 1 and token_type == 'IDENTIFIER':
            ast['VariableDecleration'].append( {'name': token_value} )
            
        # This will check to make sure the equals operator is there
        if x == 2 and token_value == '=': pass
        
        # This will check for the value which should be at the third token    
        if x == 3 and token_type == 'INTEGER' or token_type == 'STRING':
            ast['VariableDecleration'].append( {'value': token_value} )
            
    print(ast)

The following piece of code should output this as a result:

    {'VariableDecleration': [{'type': 'int'}, {'name': 'result'}, {'value': '100'}]}

As you can see all that the parser does is from the source code tokens finds a pattern for the variable declaration (in this case) and creates an object with it which holds its properties like `type`, `name` and `value`.

---
# Let's break it down

1. We created the `ast` variable which will hold the complete AST.
2. We created the examples `token` variable which holds the tokens that were created by our lexer which now needs to be parsed.
3. Next, we loop through each token and perform some checks to find certain tokens and form our AST with them.
4. We create variable for type and value for readability
5. We now perform checks like this one:

       if x == 0 and token_type == 'DATATYPE':
            ast['VariableDecleration'].append( {'type': token_value} )
    
    which looks for a datatype and adds it to the AST. We keep doing this for the value and name which will then result in a full `VariableDecleration` AST.
