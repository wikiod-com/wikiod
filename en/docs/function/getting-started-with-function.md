## Installation or Setup
A function is a block of organised, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. 

# User defined function #

A function defined by user. 

Example in PHP

       //Function definition
    
        function add ($a, $b)
        {
            $sum = $a + $b;
            return $sum;
        }
        
        //Function invokation
        
        $sum = add(1,2);
