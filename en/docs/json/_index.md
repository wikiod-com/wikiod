It is currently described by two competing standards, [RFC 71592][2] and [ECMA-404][3]. The ECMA standard is minimal, describing only the allowed grammar syntax, whereas the RFC also provides some semantic and security considerations.

   architecture for exchanging data between client and server.

   readable format and people often misunderstand as replacement of XML.

   language or have any language literals it just a specification for
   notation of data.

   almost all of the front line languages/frameworks like and support
   for the JSON data format is available in all the popular languages,
   some of which are C#, PHP, Java, C++, Python, Ruby and many more.
