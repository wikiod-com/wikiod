3D computer graphics use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2D images. 3D images are technically very complicated 2D images drawn with algorithms and vector graphics to create the illusion of depth and space. Most methods of rendering use a system of vertices and polgyons to form complete sculptures.
