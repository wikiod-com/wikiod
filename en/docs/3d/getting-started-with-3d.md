## Stereoscopy
[Stereoscopy][1] is a technique for creating or enhancing the illusion of depth in an image by stereopsis for binocular vision.

Two individual displays are rendered and displayed individually to each of the user's eyes. The offset of an object is altered based on the intended depth displayed. This technique can be used to create the illusion that a given object or environment is either closer or farther away than the actual screen or display.
