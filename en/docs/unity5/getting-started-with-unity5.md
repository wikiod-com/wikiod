## Installing Unity
Download and install the Unity Editor from the [Unity Download page][1].

## Installing Unity using Download Assistant ##
Unity Download Assistant is a small executable program which lets you select which components of the Unity Editor you want to download and install.

If you’re not sure which components you want to install, leave the default selections, click Continue, and follow the installer’s instructions. You can install components later as well.
