## Installation or Setup
There are following setups to install opencart on your webserver

1. Download the latest version of opencart for the official [website][1] or [github][2] and extract the files. In extracted files you can see the `upload` folder,  `license.txt` file and `readme.txt` file

The `upload` folder contains all the files to host open-cart website needed to upload on server. `license.txt` contains the license agreement and`readme.txt` file contains current install and upgrade instructions.

2. The next setup to upload files on web-server. You can use the **filezilla** to upload the files. 

3. Create database for you shop using cpanel . C panel provides an interface named `phpmyadmin` to create database. 

4. You have to rename the two files named `config-dist.php` to `config.php` and `admin/config-dist.php` to `admin/config.php` .

5. Final step is to run auto-installer. Open your browser and run your shop url, you can see the installation first page.
