The Kendo UI grid is a powerful widget which allows you to visualize and edit data via its table representation. It provides a variety of options about how to present and perform operations over the underlying data, such as paging, sorting, filtering, grouping, editing, etc. To feed the grid with data, you can supply either local or remote data via the Kendo UI DataSource component, used as a mediator.
