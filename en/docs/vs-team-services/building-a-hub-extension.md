A hub in VSTS is a section grouping the features based on similar functionality e.g. Code, Build etc. VSTS comes with a capability where we can extend the hubs by adding more functionalities related to current hub, making the hub more usable for the given scenario or requirement of functionality.

## Snake (Game)
This extension adds a game named snake in the VSTS, which users can play while waiting for the long running build for example.
