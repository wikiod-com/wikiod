## Getting started
Visual Studio Team Services is an hosted version of Microsoft Team Foundation Server. It doesn't require any installation as it's already done by Microsoft itself.

In order to start using Visual Studio Team Services you need to create an account [here][1] by pressing the **Free account** button. It will redirect you to the login page. Use a Microsoft account or, if you don't already have one, create it.

After you have logged in, you will be in front of this page:[![Project creation page][2]][2]
This will allow you to create a new team. Insert a project name and choose between **Git** and **Team Foundation Version Control** as version control system. By pressing the "Change details" you can select a different location for you project and the "work organization" type. After you have provided the required information, press the **Continue** button.

Once the creation progress is finished it will be presented a page like this: [![Vsts project home page][3]][3]
**Congratulations** your project has been created and it's ready to be used!


**Features and pricing details can be found in the Remarks section**
