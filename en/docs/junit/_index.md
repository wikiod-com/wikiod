JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests for [Java programming language](https://www.wikiod.com/java/getting-started-with-java-language). It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

Main features consist of:
 - **Assertions**, that let you customize how to test values in your tests
 - **Test runners**, that let you specify how to run the tests in your class
 - **Rules**, that allow you to flexibly modify the behaviour of tests in your class
 - **Suites**, that allow you to build together a suite of tests from many different classes

Useful extension for JUnit:
 - [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/index.html): Fluent assertions for java 
 - [Mockito](https://www.wikiod.com/mockito): Mocking framework for java
