PyQt is a Python binding to the popular cross-platform Qt application framework commonly used to make graphical applications. PyQt4 supports Qt4 and PyQt5 supports Qt5. It runs on all platforms supported by Qt (Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS and Android). The bindings are implemented as a set of Python modules and classes.
