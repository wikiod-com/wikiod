The DOM, or Document Object Model, is the API used by web browsers and other applications to access the contents of an HTML document.

The DOM represents the structure as a tree, nodes can contain child-nodes, nodes with no children are said leaf nodes.

With it, one can manipulate the structure and properties of the document and its constituent parts. 

Major topics include finding elements, accessing style information, and animation.

Most work with the DOM is done using the [JavaScript](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/javascript) language, but the API is open to any language.
