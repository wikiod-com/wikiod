The [Dropbox API][1] allows developers to build Dropbox functionality directly into their apps.

The API allows access to features such as file uploading, downloading, sharing, searching, and restoration. The API can be used across platforms such as Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, or any other that can make HTTPS connections.

More information, including the full documentation for the Dropbox API, usage guidelines, and developer tools such as official SDKs can be found on [the Dropbox API website][1].

The first step is to [register an API app with Dropbox][2].
