## Requirements of Team Foundation Server 2015
Team Foundation Server (TFS) can be installed in two basic infrastructure ways, Single Server Deployment and Multi-Server Deployment.  The difference between these two deployments is where the Application Tier (TFS) and the Data Tier (MS SQL) reside.

Before you can install TFS 2015, you must make sure you have met the requirements for both hardware and software.
