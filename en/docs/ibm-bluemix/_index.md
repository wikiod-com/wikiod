Bluemix is a platform as a service (PaaS) developed by IBM, to build, run, deploy, and manage applications on the cloud. Bluemix offers a large catalog of services to integrate with your applications. Supported programming languages and runtimes include Java, Node.js, Swift, Go, PHP, Python, and Ruby, with additional languages supported through the use of buildpacks.

IBM Bluemix is based on Cloud Foundry open technology. In addition to building web applications for multiple frameworks, including iOS, you can create Docker containers, or launch virtual server instances. Bluemix is based on a Hybrid Cloud model. Its apps, containers, and VMs are portable across public, dedicated, and on-premises clouds.
