## AngularJS ng-repeat introduction and challenges
ng-repeat is the built-in directive provided by AngularJS, mostly used for listing the array elements on UI dynamically as per the changes in our model.

Official "ng-repeat" docs can be found at : 
https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat

Also the most common error faced while implementation of ng-repeat is given here:
https://docs.angularjs.org/error/ngRepeat/dupes

For new comers the angularjs docs(quite informative but) might not be as descriptive but here's another link to make our understanding clear about the ng-repeat, it shows the code implementation of ng-repeat and also the challenges that come with it if not used properly:

Trying out ng-repeat with different types of array data would be beneficial to understand it more profoundly.
