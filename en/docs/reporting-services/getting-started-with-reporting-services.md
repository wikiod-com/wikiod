## Installation or Setup
SQL Server Reporting Services can typically be installed with SQL Server installation media.  An installation of SQL Server will be required, either locally or on a server.

Starting with SQL Server 2008 R2, SSRS has the option to integrate with SharePoint instead of running a separate website.
