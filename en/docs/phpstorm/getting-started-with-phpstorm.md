## Installation
## Introduction

JetBrains PhpStorm is a commercial, cross-platform IDE for PHP. It is built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA platform, which is written in Java. It will thus run on all major operating systems that support Java.

Users can extend the IDE by installing plugins created for the IntelliJ Platform.

## Requirements

### Hardware

* 1 GB RAM minimum, 2 GB RAM recommended
* 1024x768 minimum screen resolution

### Software

It is recommended to use the bundled Oracle Java Runtime Environment. OpenJDK may lead to unexpected behavior and is not officially supported.

## Installing PhpStorm

To start using PhpStorm, download the version for the desired OS from [the PhpStorm download page][1]. The next step depends on the OS.

### OS Specific instructions

- Run `PhpStorm.sh` from the `bin` sub-directory

#### OSX

## License

PhpStorm includes bundled evaluation license key for a free 30-day trial. In order to use the IDE after that period, a license for PhpStorm needs to be [acquired from Jetbrains][2]. 

Various licenses are offered free or at a discount:

### Early Access Program

As stated on [the PhpStorm EAP page][3], the pre-release software can be unstable at times:

> pre-release software. Please note that the quality of EAP versions may
> at times be way below even usual beta standards.
