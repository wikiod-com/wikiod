**Why CouchDB?**

CouchDB has a JSON document storage model with a powerful query engine based on a HTTP API.

Using JavaScript in *design* documents, you have control of ways to query, map, combine, and filter your data. Providing fault tolerance, extreme scalability, and incremental replication, CouchDB is a good choice for a non-relational, document database.

> While a traditional relational database requires you to model your
> data up front, CouchDB’s schema-free design unburdens you with a
> powerful way to aggregate your data after the fact, just like we do
> with real-world documents. We’ll look in depth at how to design
> applications with this underlying storage paradigm.
