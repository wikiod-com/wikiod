This about is taken directly from the JQuery Mobile website:

http://jquerymobile.com/about/

"jQuery Mobile is a HTML5-based user interface system designed to make responsive web sites and apps that are accessible on all smartphone, tablet and desktop devices. It is built on the rock-solid jQuery and jQuery UI foundation, and offers Ajax navigation with page transitions, touch events, and various widgets. Its lightweight code is built with progressive enhancement, and has a flexible, easily themeable design." - JQuery Mobile team

I would strongly recommend going to the site to learn more about JQuery Mobile. This is just an excerpt to help beginners.
