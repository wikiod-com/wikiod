Functional programming is a programming paradigm which models computations (and thus programs) as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It has its roots in lambda calculus, which was developed by Alonzo Church in his research on computability. 

Functional programming has some interesting concepts:

 - **Higher Order functions**
 - **Purity**
 - **Recursion**
 - **Laziness**
 - **Referential Transparency**
 - **Currying**
 - **Functors**
 - **Monads**
 - **Memoization & Tail-call Optimization**
 - **Functional Unit Testing**


Some examples of functional programming languages are [Lisp](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/lisp), [Haskell](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/haskell), [Scala](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/scala) and [Clojure](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/clojure), but also other languages, like [Python](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/python), [R](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/r) and [Javascript](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/javascript) allow to write (parts of) your programs in a functional style. Even in [Java](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/java), functional programming has found its place with [Lambda Expressions](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/java/91/lambda-expressions) and the [Stream API](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/java/88/streams) which were introduced in Java 8.
