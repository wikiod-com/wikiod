Harp is a static web server with built-in preprocessing. Harp can compile your project down to static assets, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no configuration necessary. You may also use Harp as a Node library for compiling or running as a server.

Harp includes the common, useful preprocessors by default. It serves Jade (Pug), Markdown, EJS, CoffeeScript, LESS, Sass and Stylus.


## How to set up Harp
Harp doesnâ€™t require any configuration to get started. Install Harp in your terminal using the command: `npm install -g harp`. 

    $ sudo npm install -g harp
    $ harp init myproject
    $ harp server myproject
