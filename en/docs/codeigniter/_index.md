CodeIgniter is a MVC framework written in, and for, PHP.

It is lightweight compared to other MVC frameworks out there, at the cost of having less functionality, e.g. there is no built in authentication system which might be a part of other frameworks.

CodeIgniter is a good choice of frameworks for those who are starting out with MVC as it doesn't force any particular standards for naming and structure of code; but it is also suitable for larger projects where a large range of features contained in other frameworks might not be needed.
