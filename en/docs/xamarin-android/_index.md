Xamarin.Android allows you to create native Android applications using the same UI controls as you would in Java, except with the flexibility and elegance of a modern language (C#), the power of the .NET Base Class Library (BCL), and two first-class IDEs - Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio - at their fingertips. 

For more information on installing Xamarin.Android on your Mac or Windows machine, refer to the [Getting Started][1] guides on the Xamarin developer center
