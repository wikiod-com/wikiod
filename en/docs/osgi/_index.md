OSGi is a dynamic module system specification for the JVM. It has specifications with different versions and audiences. There are multiple implementations too:

 - [Equinox](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/),
 - [Felix](http://felix.apache.org/),
 - [Knopflerfish](http://www.knopflerfish.org/)

Eclipse from its version [3]() is based on OSGi. NetBeans is also capable to handle OSGi modules since [6.9](https://netbeans.org/community/releases/69/index.html). Liferay portal also started to use OSGi as its modularization foundation since its version 7.
