JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE.

IT enables developers to design, create, test, debug, and deploy rich client applications.

The appearance of JavaFX applications can be customized using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling (see [JavaFX: CSS][1]) and (F)XML files can be used to object structures making it easy to build or develop an application (see [FXML and Controllers][2]). Scene Builder is a visual editor allowing the creation of fxml files for an UI without writing code.
