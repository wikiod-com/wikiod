*[Apache Subversion (SVN)][1] is a universal and centralized open source
version control system. Subversion is currently a project under [Apache Software Foundation (ASF)][2] and is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0][3].* 

Subversion is designed to manage and control files and directories and track changes made to them; it acts as a reliable *time machine* and *management tool* for the collaboratively developed projects. It can easily answer the standard questions any version control system has to answer reliably. For example,
* How did the project/file FOO look like on 12/12/2012 ?
* What changes were introduced by USERNAME or on 20/12/2012 ?
* Who modified the particular string since the last review?
* and much-much more.
