## Swift
- [Prerequisites](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#prerequisites)
1. iOS 8 or later, macOS 10.9 or later, all versions of tvOS and watchOS.
2. Xcode 8.0 or later required. [Realm Swift 2.3.0](https://realm.io/news/realm-objc-swift-2.3) was the last version to support Swift 2.x and Xcode 7.3.


- [Installation](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#installation)
    * Dynamic Framework
    1. Download [the latest release of Realm](https://static.realm.io/downloads/swift/realm-swift-2.4.4.zip) and extract the zip.
    2. Go to your Xcode project’s “General” settings. Drag `RealmSwift.framework` and `Realm.framework` from the appropriate Swift-versioned directory for your project in `ios/, osx/, tvos/` or `watchos/` directory to the “Embedded Binaries” section. Make sure **Copy items if needed** is selected (except if using Realm on multiple platforms in your project) and click **Finish**.
    3. In your unit test target’s “Build Settings”, add the parent path to `RealmSwift.framework` in the “Framework Search Paths” section.
    4. If using Realm in an iOS, tvOS or watchOS project, create a new “Run Script Phase” in your app’s target’s “Build Phases” and paste the following snippet in the script text field:

    <!-- language: lang-bash -->
        bash "${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/Realm.framework/strip-frameworks.sh"

    This step is required to work around an [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) when archiving universal binaries.

    * CocoaPods
    1. [Install CocoaPods 0.39.0 or later.](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
    2. Run `pod repo update` to make CocoaPods aware of the latest available Realm versions.
    3. In your Podfile, add `use_frameworks!` and `pod 'RealmSwift'` to your main and test targets.
    4. If using Xcode 8, paste the following at the bottom of your Podfile, updating the Swift version if necessary:

    <!-- language: lang-ruby -->
        post_install do |installer|
          installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
            target.build_configurations.each do |config|
              config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '3.0'
            end
          end
        end

    5. From the command line, run `pod install`.
    6. Use the `.xcworkspace` file generated by CocoaPods to work on your project!

    * Carthage
    1. [Install Carthage 0.17.0 or later.](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)
    2. Add `github "realm/realm-cocoa"` to your Cartfile.
    3. Run `carthage update`.
    4. Drag `RealmSwift.framework` and `Realm.framework` from the appropriate platform directory in `Carthage/Build/` to the “Linked Frameworks and Libraries” section of your Xcode project’s “General” settings.
    5. **iOS/tvOS/watchOS**: On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script with the following contents:

    <!-- language: lang-bash -->
      /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
 
    and add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under “Input Files”, e.g.:

    <!-- language: lang-bash -->
      $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Realm.framework
      $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/RealmSwift.framework

    This script works around an [App Store submission bug](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) triggered by universal binaries.
