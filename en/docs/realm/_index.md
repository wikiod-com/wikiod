Realm is a mobile-first database solution designed to provide fast queries with low-memory consumption through usage of lazy-evaluation, along with type-safe and live-updating model objects.

Realm is available for multiple platforms, and therefore encompasses multiple projects:

- [Realm Objective-C](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/)
- [Realm Swift](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/)
- [Realm Java](https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/)
- [Realm JavaScript](https://realm.io/docs/javascript/latest/)
- [Realm Xamarin](https://realm.io/docs/xamarin/latest/)
