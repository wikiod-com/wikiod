The **datepicker** is a [graphical user interface][1] [widget][2] which allows the user to select a date from a calendar and/or time from a time range. The typical practice is to provide a [text box][3] field which, when clicked upon to enter a date, pops up a calendar next to or below the field, allowing the user to populate the field with an appropriate date, or provides a text box with an icon of a calendar such that when the icon is clicked on, the calendar (or time field) appears.
