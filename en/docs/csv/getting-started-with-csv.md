## Installation or Setup
A CSV file itself requires no installation as it is just a plain text file, usually with `.csv` extension.

A CSV file usually contains records. Each line represents one record and is separated by a delimiter, most commonly a comma; but semicolons and tabs are also frequently used. Each line should have the same number of fields.

example.csv:

    Name,Age,Skill,Height,Friendly
    Bob,22,10,6.3,yes
    Frank,12,7,5.5,no



## Processing csv files in various systems and languages
Small, simple csv files can be built using just a text editor, because a CSV file is simply text. If you have spreadsheet software available these are usually an easy way to open and save CSV files. 

Reading and writing them, or otherwise processing their contents is done more efficiently using the products available for one's language or systems of choice.
