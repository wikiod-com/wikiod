Haxe is an open source toolkit that is capable of compiling to many different target languages and platforms.

It consists of:

 - the [Haxe programming language][1] - a modern, high-level, and strictly typed programming language
 - the [Haxe standard library][2] - a collection of general purpose, system, and target-specific APIs
 - the [Haxe compiler][3] - a fast, optimising cross-compiler with metadata support, dead code elimination (DCE), completion mode, resource embedding, runtime type information (RTTI), static analyzer, macros, and more

Haxe has been [used to create][4] games, web, mobile, desktop, and command-line applications, as well as cross-platform APIs.

As of Haxe 3.3.0-rc.1, Haxe can compile to sources / bytecode of the following languages: ActionScript 3, C#, C++, Flash, HL, Lua, Java, JavaScript, Neko, PHP, and Python.

Haxe has a package manager, [Haxelib][5], which is bundled with Haxe. It also has a custom build file format, `.hxml`, which offers an easier way of passing arguments passed to the Haxe compiler.
