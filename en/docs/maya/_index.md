This documentation covers coding for [Autodesk Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview-dts).  It's **not** meant for end-users of the Maya software. (To find out how to model or animate in Maya, try [Autodesk's introductory videos](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/getting-started?sort=score) or an end-user site like [CGSociety](http://forums.cgsociety.org/).)

Languages
-----------

Maya supports 3 programming languages: MEL, its built-in scripting language; C++, which is used for plugins; and Python which is common for integration jobs but can also create plugins using a wrapped version of the C++ API
