## Installation or Setup
To begin using YouTube, just head over to [youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com) and use the search bar on the top of the page to find the required subject. Alternatively, you could just browse the home page. On this page, you can search the popular and trending videos, from Music, to gaming. If you wish to participate with comments, likes, playlists, or even your own videos, you need a Google account. Head over to [google.com/signup](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) to create an account. After that, just sign into Google, click the 9 dots in the top right, and then click on YouTube. After that, you should be able to input to the YouTube community.

## What is YouTube
YouTube is an online video streaming service, unique in the fact that users can upload their own videos for the purposes of sharing whatever they recorded. This can range massively, from someone cooking breakfast, to playing a live concert. Now owned by Google Inc., this site has always been free to use and still is. The only difference being that you now require a Google account to sign in, whereas before it was a separate service. See the Installation or Setup guide for more.
