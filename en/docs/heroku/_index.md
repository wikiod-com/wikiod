Heroku is a popular Platform-as-a-Service provider (PaaS) which makes it easy for developers to deploy web applications without an operations team. Heroku has been around since 2007, and is now owned by [Salesforce][1].

This section provides an overview of what Heroku is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within Heroku, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for Heroku is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
