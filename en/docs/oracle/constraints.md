## Update foreign keys with new value in Oracle
Suppose you have a table and you want to change one of this table primary id. you can use the following scrpit. primary ID here is "PK_S"

    begin
      for i in (select a.table_name, c.column_name
                  from user_constraints a, user_cons_columns c
                 where a.CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'R'
                   and a.R_CONSTRAINT_NAME = 'PK_S'
                   and c.constraint_name = a.constraint_name) loop
      
                         
             execute immediate 'update ' || i.table_name || ' set ' || i.column_name ||
                          '=to_number(''1000'' || ' ||  i.column_name || ') ';              
                        
                         
     
      end loop;
    
    end;



## Disable all related foreign keys in oracle
Suppose you have the table T1 and it has relation with many tables and its primary key constraint name is "pk_t1" you want to disable these foreign keys you can use:

    Begin
        For I in (select table_name, constraint_name from user_constraint t where   r_constraint_name='pk_t1') loop
    
    Execute immediate ' alter table ' || I.table_name || ' disable constraint ' || i.constraint_name;
    
       End loop;
    End;ï»¿
