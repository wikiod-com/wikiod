## Creating a database link
    CREATE DATABASE LINK dblink_name 
    CONNECT TO remote_username 
    IDENTIFIED BY remote_password 
    USING 'tns_service_name';

The remote DB will then be accessible in the following way:

    SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE@dblink_name;

To test a database link connection without needing to know any of the object names in the linked database, use the following query:
    
    SELECT * FROM DUAL@dblink_name;

To explicitly specify a domain for the linked database service, the domain name is added to the `USING` statement. For example:

    USING 'tns_service_name.WORLD'

If no domain name is explicitly specified, Oracle uses the domain of the database in which the link is being created.

## Create Database Link
Let we assume we have two databases "ORA1" and "ORA2". We can access the objects of "ORA2" from database "ORA1" using a database link. 

Prerequisites:
For creating a private Database link you need a `CREATE DATABASE LINK` privilege.
For creating a private Database link you need a `CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` privilege.

*[Oracle Net][1] must be present on both the instances.

How to create a database link:

From ORA1:

    SQL> create <public> database link ora2 connect to user1 identified by pass1 using <tns name of ora2>;

Database link created.

Now that we have the DB link set up, we can prove that by running the following from ORA1:

    SQL> Select name from V$DATABASE@ORA2; -- should return ORA2

You can also access the DB Objects of "ORA2" from "ORA1", given the user `user1` has the `SELECT` privilege on those objects on ORA2 (such as TABLE1 below):

      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TABLE1@ORA2;

Pre-requistes:

- Both databases must be up and running (opened).
- Both database listeners must be up and running.
- TNS must be configured correctly.
- User user1 must be present in ORA2 database, password must be checked and verified.
- User user1 must have at least the `SELECT` privilege, or any other required to access the objects on ORA2.
