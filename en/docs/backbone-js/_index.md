Backbone is a simple but robust client-side JavaScript library for building applications. Data is represented as Models, which can be gathered into Collections. Model state is displayed with [Views](https://www.wikiod.com/backbone-js/view).

Backbone attempts to provide the minimal set of data structure and user interface primitives that would be useful in a JavaScript web application. Its goal is to provide these tools without dictating how to use them or what your use-case should look like. This means that the developer is given a lot of freedom to design the full experience of their application.
