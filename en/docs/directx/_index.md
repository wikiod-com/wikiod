https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX
> Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms.

Although DirectX contains a number of sub-components, DirectX is frequently referred to interchangeably with its most popular component, [Direct3D][1], which is used to render 3D graphics. However, in its current form, it does include components for 2D graphics [Direct2D][2], audio [XAudio2][3] and input [XInput][4].
