Understanding writing your own mods for Minecraft.

The first thing to know is that there are primarily two platforms which mods are build on. Forge and Bukkit.

Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages and are generally not compatible with each other. Forge mods run the gamut and are generally game-play oriented. Bukkit mods are entirely server-based and generally admin tool oriented. Bukkit mods are called plugins.
