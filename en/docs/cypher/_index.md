[Cypher][1] is a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient querying and updating of a property graph.

Cypher was originally created by Neo Technology for its graph database Neo4j, but was opened up through the [openCypher project][2] in October 2015 and has since been adopted by several other graph database vendors, including SAP HANA and AgensGraph.
