VHDL is a compound acronym for VHSIC (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit) HDL (Hardware Description Language). As a Hardware Description Language, it is primarily used to describe or model circuits. VHDL is an ideal language for describing circuits since it offers language constructs that easily describe both concurrent and sequential behavior along with an execution model that removes ambiguity introduced when modeling concurrent behavior.

VHDL is typically interpreted in two different contexts: for simulation and for synthesis.  When interpreted for synthesis, code is converted (synthesized) to the equivalent hardware elements that are modeled. Only a subset of the VHDL is typically available for use during synthesis, and supported language constructs are not standardized; it is a function of the synthesis engine used and the target hardware device. When VHDL is interpreted for simulation, all language constructs are available for modeling the behavior of hardware.
