## Syntax
 - a = [] # using array literal
 - a = Array.new # equivalent to using literal
 - a = Array.new(5) # create an array with 5 elements with value of nil.
 - a = Array.new(5, 0) # create an array with 5 elements with default value of 0.

## Create Array of Strings
Arrays of strings can be created using ruby's [percent string](http://ruby-doc.org/core/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Percent+Strings) syntax:

    array = %w(one two three four)

This is functionally equivalent to defining the array as:

    array = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']

Instead of `%w()` you may use other matching pairs of delimiters: `%w{...}`, `%w[...]` or `%w<...>`.

It is also possible to use arbitrary non-alphanumeric delimiters, such as: `%w!...!`, `%w#...#` or `%w@...@`.

`%W` can be used instead of `%w` to incorporate string interpolation. Consider the following:

    var = 'hello'

    %w(#{var}) # => ["\#{var}"]
    %W(#{var}) # => ["hello"]

Multiple words can be interpreted by escaping the space with a \\.

    %w(Colorado California New\ York) # => ["Colorado", "California", "New York"]




## Create Array with Array::new
An empty Array (`[]`) can be created with Array's class method, `Array::new`:

    Array.new    

To set the length of the array, pass a numerical argument:

    Array.new 3 #=> [nil, nil, nil]

There are two ways to populate an array with default values:
* Pass an immutable value as second argument.
* Pass a block that gets current index and generates mutable values.


    Array.new 3, :x #=> [:x, :x, :x]

    Array.new(3) { |i| i.to_s } #=> ["0", "1", "2"]

    a = Array.new 3, "X"            # Not recommended.
    a[1].replace "C"                # a => ["C", "C", "C"]
    
    b = Array.new(3) { "X" }        # The recommended way.
    b[1].replace "C"                # b => ["X", "C", "X"]


## Create Array of Symbols
<!-- if version [gte 2.0] -->
    array = %i(one two three four)
<!-- end version if -->
Creates the array `[:one, :two, :three, :four]`.

Instead of `%i(...)`, you may use `%i{...}` or `%i[...]` or `%i!...!`

Additionally, if you want to use interpolation, you can do this with `%I`.

<!-- if version [gte 2.0] -->
    a = 'hello'
    b = 'goodbye'
    array_one = %I(#{a} #{b} world)
    array_two = %i(#{a} #{b} world)
<!-- end version if -->
Creates the arrays:
`array_one = [:hello, :goodbye, :world]` and `array_two = [:"\#{a}", :"\#{b}", :world]`

## Manipulating Array Elements
Adding elements:

    [1, 2, 3] << 4
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4]

    [1, 2, 3].push(4)
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4]

    [1, 2, 3].unshift(4)
    # => [4, 1, 2, 3]

    [1, 2, 3] << [4, 5]
    # => [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]

Removing elements:

    array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    array.pop
    # => 4
    array
    # => [1, 2, 3]
    
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    array.shift
    # => 1
    array
    # => [2, 3, 4]
    
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    array.delete(1)
    # => 1
    array
    # => [2, 3, 4]

    array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    array.delete_at(2) // delete from index 2
    # => 3  
    array 
    # => [1,2,4,5,6] 


    array = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
    array - [2]
    # => [1, 3]    # removed all the 2s
    array - [2, 3, 4]
    # => [1]       # the 4 did nothing

Combining arrays:

    [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    
    [1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6])
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] - [2, 3]
    # => [1, 4, 5, 6]

    [1, 2, 3] | [2, 3, 4]
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4]

    [1, 2, 3] & [3, 4]
    # => [3]
    
    
You can also multiply arrays, e.g.

    [1, 2, 3] * 2
    # => [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]



## Creating an Array with the literal constructor [ ]
Arrays can be created by enclosing a list of elements in square brackets (`[` and `]`). Array elements in this notation are separated with commas:

    array = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Arrays can contain any kind of objects in any combination with no restrictions on type:

    array = [1, 'b', nil, [3, 4]]



## Accessing elements
You can access the elements of an array by their indices.
Array index numbering starts at `0`.

    %w(a b c)[0] # => 'a'
    %w(a b c)[1] # => 'b'

You can crop an array using range

    %w(a b c d)[1..2] # => ['b', 'c'] (indices from 1 to 2, including the 2)
    %w(a b c d)[1...2] # => ['b'] (indices from 1 to 2, excluding the 2)

This returns a new array, but doesn't affect the original.
Ruby also supports the use of negative indices.

    %w(a b c)[-1] # => 'c'
    %w(a b c)[-2] # => 'b'

You can combine negative and positive indices as well

    %w(a b c d e)[1...-1] # => ['b', 'c', 'd']

**Other useful methods**

Use `first` to access the first element in an array:

    [1, 2, 3, 4].first # => 1

Or `first(n)` to access the first `n` elements returned in an array:

    [1, 2, 3, 4].first(2) # => [1, 2]

Similarly for `last` and `last(n)`:

    [1, 2, 3, 4].last    # => 4
    [1, 2, 3, 4].last(2) # => [3, 4]

Use `sample` to access a random element in a array:

    [1, 2, 3, 4].sample  # => 3
    [1, 2, 3, 4].sample  # => 1

Or `sample(n)`:

    [1, 2, 3, 4].sample(2) # => [2, 1]
    [1, 2, 3, 4].sample(2) # => [3, 4]

## Arrays union, intersection and difference
    x = [5, 5, 1, 3]
    y = [5, 2, 4, 3]

Union (`|`) contains elements from both arrays, with duplicates removed:

    x | y
    => [5, 1, 3, 2, 4]

Intersection (`&`) contains elements which are present both in first and second array:

    x & y
    => [5, 3]

Difference (`-`) contains elements which are present in first array and not present in second array:

    x - y
    => [1]



## Decomposition
Any array can be quickly **decomposed** by assigning its elements into multiple variables. A simple example:

    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    # ---
    a = arr[0]
    b = arr[1]
    c = arr[2]
    # --- or, the same
    a, b, c = arr

Preceding a variable with the *splat* operator (`*`) puts into it an array of all the elements that haven't been captured by other variables. If none are left, empty array is assigned. Only one splat can be used in a single assignment:

    a, *b = arr       # a = 1; b = [2, 3]
    a, *b, c = arr    # a = 1; b = [2]; c = 3
    a, b, c, *d = arr # a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; d = []
    a, *b, *c = arr   # SyntaxError: unexpected *

Decomposition is *safe* and never raises errors. `nil`s are assigned where there's not enough elements, matching the behavior of `[]` operator when accessing an index out of bounds:

    arr[9000] # => nil
    a, b, c, d = arr # a = 1; b = 2; c = 3; d = nil

Decomposition tries to call `to_ary` implicitly on the object being assigned. By implementing this method in your type you get the ability to decompose it:

    class Foo
      def to_ary
        [1, 2]
      end
    end
    a, b = Foo.new # a = 1; b = 2

If the object being decomposed doesn't `respond_to?` `to_ary`, it's treated as a single-element array:

    1.respond_to?(:to_ary) # => false
    a, b = 1 # a = 1; b = nil

Decomposition can also be **nested** by using a `()`-delimited decomposition expression in place of what otherwise would be a single element:

    arr = [1, [2, 3, 4], 5, 6]
    a, (b, *c), *d = arr # a = 1; b = 2; c = [3, 4]; d = [5, 6]
    #   ^^^^^

This is effectively the opposite of *splat*.

Actually, any decomposition expression can be delimited by `()`. But for the first level decomposition is optional.

    a, b = [1, 2]
    (a, b) = [1, 2] # the same thing

**Edge case:** *a single identifier* cannot be used as a destructuring pattern, be it outer or a nested one:

    (a) = [1] # SyntaxError
    a, (b) = [1, [2]] # SyntaxError

When assigning **an array literal** to a destructuring expression, outer `[]` can be omitted:

    a, b = [1, 2]
    a, b =  1, 2  # exactly the same

This is known as **parallel assignment**, but it uses the same decomposition under the hood. This is particularly handy for exchanging variables' values without employing additional temporary variables:

    t = a; a = b; b = t # an obvious way
    a, b = b, a         # an idiomatic way
    (a, b) = [b, a]     # ...and how it works

Values are captured when building the right-hand side of the assignment, so using the same variables as source and destination is relatively safe.

## #map
`#map`, provided by Enumerable, creates an array by invoking a block on each element and collecting the results:

    [1, 2, 3].map { |i| i * 3 }
    # => [3, 6, 9]
   
    ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5'].map { |i| i.to_i }
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The original array is not modified; a new array is returned containing the transformed values in the same order as the source values. `map!` can be used if you want to modify the original array. 

In `map` method you can call method or use proc to all elements in array.

    # call to_i method on all elements
    %w(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10).map(&:to_i)
    # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    
    # using proc (lambda) on all elements
    %w(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10).map(&->(i){ i.to_i * 2})
    # => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]

`map` is synonymous with `collect`.

## Filtering arrays
Often we want to operate only on elements of an array that fulfill a specific condition:

## [Select][1]
Will return elements that match a specific condition

    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    array.select { |number| number > 3 } # => [4, 5, 6]

## [Reject][2]
Will return elements that do not match a specific condition

    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    array.reject { |number| number > 3 } # => [1, 2, 3]

Both `#select` and `#reject` return an array, so they can be chained:

    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    array.select { |number| number > 3 }.reject { |number| number < 5 }
      # => [5, 6]

## Inject, reduce
Inject and reduce are different names for the same thing. In other languages these functions are often called folds (like foldl or foldr). These methods are available on every Enumerable object.

Inject takes a two argument function and applies that to all of the pairs of elements in the Array.

For the array `[1, 2, 3]` we can add all of these together with the starting value of zero by specifying a starting value and block like so:


    [1,2,3].reduce(0) {|a,b| a + b} # => 6



Here we pass the function a starting value and a block that says to add all of the values together. The block is first run with `0` as `a` and `1` as `b` it then takes the result of that as the next `a` so we are then adding `1` to the second value `2`. Then we take the result of that (`3`) and add that on to the final element in the list (also `3`) giving us our result (`6`).

If we omit the first argument, it will set `a` to being the first element in the list, so the example above is the same as:


    [1,2,3].reduce {|a,b| a + b} # => 6

In addition, instead of passing a block with a function, we can pass a named function as a symbol, either with a starting value, or without. With this, the above example could be written as:

    [1,2,3].reduce(0, :+) # => 6

or omitting the starting value:

    [1,2,3].reduce(:+) # => 6

## Two-dimensional array
Using the [`Array::new`](https://www.wikiod.com/ruby/arrays#Create Array with Array::new) constructor, your can initialize an array with a given size and a new array in each of its slots. The inner arrays can also be given a size and and initial value.

For instance, to create a 3x4 array of zeros:

    array = Array.new(3) { Array.new(4) { 0 } }

The array generated above looks like this when printed with `p`:

    [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

You can read or write to elements like this:

    x = array[0][1]
    array[2][3] = 2


## Arrays and the splat (*) operator
The `*` operator can be used to unpack variables and arrays so that they can be passed as individual arguments to a method.

This can be used to wrap a single object in an Array if it is not already:

    def wrap_in_array(value)
      [*value]
    end

    wrap_in_array(1)
    #> [1]

    wrap_in_array([1, 2, 3])
    #> [1, 2, 3]

    wrap_in_array(nil)
    #> []
   
In the above example, the `wrap_in_array` method accepts one argument, `value`.

If `value` is an `Array`, its elements are unpacked and a new array is created containing those element.

If `value` is a single object, a new array is created containing that single object.

If `value` is `nil`, an empty array is returned.

The splat operator is particularly handy when used as an argument in methods in some cases. For example, it allows `nil`, single values and arrays to be handled in a consistent manner:

    def list(*values)
      values.each do |value|
        # do something with value
        puts value
      end
    end

    list(100)
    #> 100

    list([100, 200])
    #> 100
    #> 200

    list(nil)
    # nothing is outputted


## Turn multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional (flattened) array
    [1, 2, [[3, 4], [5]], 6].flatten  # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

If you have a multi-dimensional array and you need to make it a _simple_ (i.e. one-dimensional) array, you can use the **`#flatten`** method.


## Get unique array elements
In case you need to read an array elements _**avoiding repetitions**_ you case use the **`#uniq`** method:

    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
    a.uniq
    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Instead, if you want to remove all duplicated elements from an array, you may use **`#uniq!`** method:

    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
    a.uniq!
    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

While the output is the same, **`#uniq!`** also stores the new array:

    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
    a.uniq
    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    a
    #=> [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]

    a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
    a.uniq!
    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    a
    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    

## Get all combinations / permutations of an array
The `permutation` method, when called with a block yields a two dimensional array consisting of all ordered sequences of a collection of numbers.

If this method is called without a block, it will return an `enumerator`. To convert to an array, call the `to_a` method.


| Example | Result |
| ------ | ------ |
| `[1,2,3].permutation`   | `#<Enumerator: [1,2,3]:permutation`   |
| `[1,2,3].permutation.to_a` | `[[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]`
| `[1,2,3].permutation(2).to_a`    | `[[1,2],[1,3],[2,1],[2,3],[3,1],[3,2]]` |
| `[1,2,3].permutation(4).to_a`    | `[]` -> No permutations of length 4|

The `combination` method on the other hand, when called with a block yields a two-dimensional array consisting of all sequences of a collection of numbers. Unlike permutation, order is disregarded in combinations. For example, `[1,2,3]` is the same as `[3,2,1]`

| Example | Result |
| ------ | ------ |
| `[1,2,3].combination(1)`   | `#<Enumerator: [1,2,3]:combination`   
| `[1,2,3].combination(1).to_a` | `[[1],[2],[3]]`
| `[1,2,3].combination(3).to_a`    | `[[1,2,3]]` 
| `[1,2,3].combination(4).to_a`    | `[]` -> No combinations of length 4

Calling the combination method by itself will result in an enumerator. To get an array, call the `to_a` method.

The `repeated_combination` and `repeated_permutation` methods are similar, except the same element can be repeated multiple times.

For example the sequences `[1,1]`, `[1,3,3,1]`, `[3,3,3]` would not be valid in regular combinations and permutations. 

| Example | \# Combos |
| ------ | ------ |
| `[1,2,3].combination(3).to_a.length`   | 1 
| `[1,2,3].repeated_combination(3).to_a.length` | 6
| `[1,2,3,4,5].combination(5).to_a.length`    | 1
| `[1,2,3].repeated_combination(5).to_a.length`    | 126

## Remove all nil elements from an array with #compact
If an array happens to have one or more `nil` elements and these need to be removed, the `Array#compact` or `Array#compact!` methods can be used, as below.

    array = [ 1, nil, 'hello', nil, '5', 33]

    array.compact # => [ 1, 'hello', '5', 33]

    #notice that the method returns a new copy of the array with nil removed,
    #without affecting the original

    array = [ 1, nil, 'hello', nil, '5', 33]

    #If you need the original array modified, you can either reassign it

    array = array.compact # => [ 1, 'hello', '5', 33]
    
    array = [ 1, 'hello', '5', 33]

    #Or you can use the much more elegant 'bang' version of the method

    array = [ 1, nil, 'hello', nil, '5', 33]

    array.compact # => [ 1, 'hello', '5', 33]
    
    array = [ 1, 'hello', '5', 33]

Finally, notice that if `#compact` or `#compact!` are called on an array with no `nil` elements, these will return nil.

    array = [ 'foo', 4, 'life']

    array.compact # => nil

    array.compact! # => nil

## Create an Array of consecutive numbers or letters
This can be easily accomplished by calling [`Enumerable#to_a`][1] on a `Range` object:

    (1..10).to_a    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

`(a..b)` means that it will include all numbers between a and b. To exclude the last number, use `a...b`

    a_range = 1...5
    a_range.to_a       #=> [1, 2, 3, 4]

or

    ('a'..'f').to_a    #=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
    ('a'...'f').to_a   #=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

A convenient shortcut for creating an array is `[*a..b]`

    [*1..10]           #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    [*'a'..'f']        #=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]

  [1]: http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-to_a


## Create Array of numbers
The normal way to create an array of numbers:

    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Range objects can be used extensively to create an array of numbers:

    numbers = Array(1..10) # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    numbers = (1..10).to_a # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


`#step` and `#map` methods allow us to impose conditions on the range of numbers:

    odd_numbers = (1..10).step(2).to_a # => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

    even_numbers = 2.step(10, 2).to_a # => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

    squared_numbers = (1..10).map { |number| number * number } # => [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

All the above methods load the numbers eagerly. If you have to load them lazily: 
    
    number_generator = (1..100).lazy # => #<Enumerator::Lazy: 1..100>

    number_generator.first(10) # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


## Cast to Array from any object
To get Array from any object, use `Kernel#Array`.

The following is an example:

    Array('something') #=> ["something"]
    Array([2, 1, 5])   #=> [2, 1, 5]
    Array(1)           #=> [1]
    Array(2..4)        #=> [2, 3, 4]
    Array([])          #=> []
    Array(nil)         #=> []

For example, you could replace `join_as_string` method from the following code

    def join_as_string(arg)
      if arg.instance_of?(Array)
        arg.join(',')
      elsif arg.instance_of?(Range)
        arg.to_a.join(',')
      else
        arg.to_s
      end
    end
    
    join_as_string('something') #=> "something"
    join_as_string([2, 1, 5])   #=> "2,1,5"
    join_as_string(1)           #=> "1"
    join_as_string(2..4)        #=> "2,3,4"
    join_as_string([])          #=> ""
