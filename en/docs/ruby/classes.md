## Syntax
* class Name
* #some code describing the class behavior
* end

Class names in Ruby are Constants, so the first letter should be a capital.

    class Cat # correct
    end  
    
    class dog # wrong, throws an error
    end

## Constructor
A class can have only one constructor, that is a method called `initialize`. The method is automatically invoked when a new instance of the class is created.

    class Customer
      def initialize(name)
         @name = name.capitalize 
      end
    end
   
    sarah = Customer.new('sarah')
    sarah.name #=> 'Sarah'

## Creating a class
You can define a new class using the `class` keyword.

    class MyClass
    end

Once defined, you can create a new instance using the `.new` method

    somevar = MyClass.new
    # => #<MyClass:0x007fe2b8aa4a18>

## Access Levels
Ruby has three access levels. They are `public`, `private` and `protected`. 

Methods that follow the `private` or `protected` keywords are defined as such. Methods that come before these are implicitly `public` methods.


## **Public Methods** ##

A public method should describe the behavior of the object being created. These methods can be called from outside the scope of the created object. 
    
    class Cat
      def initialize(name)
        @name = name
      end

      def speak
        puts "I'm #{@name} and I'm 2 years old"
      end
      
      ...
    end
    
    new_cat = Cat.new("garfield")
    #=> <Cat:0x2321868 @name="garfield">
     
    new_cat.speak
    #=> I'm garfield and I'm 2 years old

These methods are public ruby methods, they describe the behavior for initializing a new cat and the behavior of the speak method. 

`public` keyword is unnecessary, but can be used to escape `private` or `protected`

    def MyClass
      def first_public_method
      end

      private

      def private_method
      end

      public

      def second_public_method
      end
    end
## **Private Methods** ##

Private methods are not accessible from outside of the object. They are used internally by the object. Using the cat example again:
         
    class Cat
      def initialize(name)
        @name = name
      end

      def speak
        age = calculate_cat_age # here we call the private method 
        puts "I'm #{@name} and I'm #{age} years old"
      end

      private
         def calculate_cat_age
           2 * 3 - 4 
         end
    end

    my_cat = Cat.new("Bilbo")
    my_cat.speak #=> I'm Bilbo and I'm 2 years old
    my_cat.calculate_cat_age #=> NoMethodError: private method `calculate_cat_age' called for #<Cat:0x2321868 @name="Bilbo">

As you can see in the example above, the newly created Cat object has access to the `calculate_cat_age` method internally. We assign the variable `age` to the result of running the private `calculate_cat_age` method which prints the name and age of the cat to the console.

When we try and call the `calculate_cat_age` method from outside the `my_cat` object, we receive a `NoMethodError` because it's private. Get it?

## **Protected Methods** ##

Protected methods are very similar to private methods. They cannot be accessed outside the instance of object in the same way private methods can't be. However, using the <code>self</code> ruby method, protected methods can be called within the context of an object of the same type. 

    class Cat
      def initialize(name, age)
        @name = name
        @age = age
      end

      def speak
        puts "I'm #{@name} and I'm #{@age} years old"
      end

      # this == method allows us to compare two objects own ages. 
      # if both Cat's have the same age they will be considered equal.
      def ==(other)
         self.own_age == other.own_age
      end

      protected
         def own_age
            self.age
         end
    end

    cat1 = Cat.new("ricky", 2)
    => #<Cat:0x007fe2b8aa4a18 @name="ricky", @age=2>

    cat2 = Cat.new("lucy", 4)
    => #<Cat:0x008gfb7aa6v67 @name="lucy", @age=4>

    cat3 = Cat.new("felix", 2)
    => #<Cat:0x009frbaa8V76 @name="felix", @age=2>

You can see we've added an age parameter to the cat class and created three new cat objects with the name and age. We are going to call the `own_age` protected method to compare the age's of our cat objects.

    cat1 == cat2
    => false

    cat1 == cat3
    => true

Look at that, we were able to retrieve cat1's age using the <code>self.own_age</code> protected method and compare it against cat2's age by calling <code>cat2.own_age</code> inside of cat1. 

## Accessing instance variables with getters and setters
We have three methods: 

 1. __`attr_reader`__: used to allow `read`ing the variable outside the class.
 2.  __`attr_writer`__: used to allow modifying the variable outside the class.
 3. __`attr_accessor`__: combines both methods.


    class Cat
      attr_reader :age # you can read the age but you can never change it
      attr_writer :name # you can change name but you are not allowed to read
      attr_accessor :breed # you can both change the breed and read it

      def initialize(name, breed)
        @name = name
        @breed = breed
        @age = 2 
      end
      def speak
        puts "I'm #{@name} and I am a #{@breed} cat"
      end
    end
     
    my_cat = Cat.new("Banjo", "birman")
    # reading values:

    my_cat.age  #=> 2
    my_cat.breed #=> "birman"
    my_cat.name #=> Error
    
    # changing values
     
    my_cat.age = 3 #=> Error
    my_cat.breed = "sphynx" 
    my_cat.name = "Bilbo"

    my_cat.speak #=> I'm Bilbo and I am a sphynx cat

 Note that the parameters are symbols. this works by creating a method.

    class Cat
      attr_accessor :breed
    end

Is basically the same as:

    class Cat
      def breed
        @breed
      end
      def breed= value
        @breed = value
      end
    end

## Class Methods types
Classes have 3 types of methods: instance, singleton and class methods.

Instance Methods
================

These are methods that can be called from an `instance` of the class.

    class Thing
      def somemethod
        puts "something"
      end
    end
    
    foo = Thing.new # create an instance of the class
    foo.somemethod # => something

Class Method
============

These are static methods, i.e,  they can be invoked on the class, and not on an instantiation of that class.

    class Thing
      def Thing.hello(name)
        puts "Hello, #{name}!"
      end
    end

It is equivalent to use `self` in place of the class name. The following code is equivalent to the code above:

    class Thing
      def self.hello(name)
        puts "Hello, #{name}!"
      end
    end

Invoke the method by writing

    Thing.hello("John Doe")  # prints: "Hello, John Doe!"

Singleton Methods
================

These are only available to specific instances of the class, but not to all.

    # create an empty class
    class Thing
    end
    
    # two instances of the class
    thing1 = Thing.new
    thing2 = Thing.new
    
    # create a singleton method
    def thing1.makestuff
      puts "I belong to thing one"
    end

    thing1.makestuff # => prints: I belong to thing one
    thing2.makestuff # NoMethodError: undefined method `makestuff' for #<Thing>

Both the `singleton` and `class` methods are called `eigenclass`es. Basically, what ruby does is to create an anonymous class that holds such methods so that it won't interfere with the instances that are created.

Another way of doing this is by the `class <<` constructor. For example:

    # a class method (same as the above example)
    class Thing
      class << self # the anonymous class
        def hello(name)
          puts "Hello, #{name}!"
        end
      end
    end

    Thing.hello("sarah") # => Hello, sarah!

    # singleton method

    class Thing
    end

    thing1 = Thing.new

    class << thing1
      def makestuff
        puts "I belong to thing one"
      end
    end

    thing1.makestuff # => prints: "I belong to thing one"

## Dynamic class creation
Classes can be created dynamically through the use of `Class.new`.

<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

    # create a new class dynamically
    MyClass = Class.new

    # instantiate an object of type MyClass
    my_class = MyClass.new

In the above example, a new class is created and assigned to the constant `MyClass`.  This class can be instantiated and used just like any other class.

The `Class.new` method accepts a `Class` which will become the superclass of the dynamically created class.

    # dynamically create a class that subclasses another
    Staffy = Class.new(Dog)

    # instantiate an object of type Staffy
    lucky = Staffy.new
    lucky.is_a?(Staffy) # true
    lucky.is_a?(Dog)    # true

The `Class.new` method also accepts a block.  The context of the block is the newly created class.  This allows methods to be defined.

    Duck = 
      Class.new do
        def quack
          'Quack!!'
        end
      end

    # instantiate an object of type Duck
    duck = Duck.new
    duck.quack # 'Quack!!'

## New, allocate, and initialize
In many languages, new instances of a class are created using a special `new` keyword. In Ruby, `new` is also used to create instances of a class, but it isn't a keyword; instead, it's a static/class method, no different from any other static/class method. The definition is roughly this:

    class MyClass
       def self.new(*args)
         obj = allocate
         obj.initialize(*args) # oversimplied; initialize is actually private
         obj
       end
    end

`allocate` performs the real 'magic' of creating an uninitialized instance of the class

Note also that the return value of `initialize` is discarded, and obj is returned instead. This makes it immediately clear why you can code your initialize method without worrying about returning `self` at the end.

The 'normal' `new` method that all classes get from `Class` works as above, but it's possible to redefine it however you like, or to define alternatives that work differently. For example:

    class MyClass
      def self.extraNew(*args)
        obj = allocate
        obj.pre_initialize(:foo)
        obj.initialize(*args)
        obj.post_initialize(:bar)
        obj
      end
    end

## Class and instance variables
There are several special variable types that a class can use for more easily sharing data. 

Instance variables, preceded by `@`. They are useful if you want to use the same variable in different methods.

    class Person
      def initialize(name, age)
        my_age = age # local variable, will be destroyed at end of constructor
        @name = name # instance variable, is only destroyed when the object is
      end

      def some_method
        puts "My name is #{@name}." # we can use @name with no problem
      end
       
      def another_method
        puts "My age is #{my_age}." # this will not work!
      end
    end

    mhmd = Person.new("Mark", 23)

    mhmd.some_method #=> My name is Mark.
    mhmd.another_method #=> throws an error

Class variable, preceded by `@@`. They contain the same values across all instances of a class. 

    class Person
      @@persons_created = 0 # class variable, available to all objects of this class
      def initialize(name)
        @name = name

        # modification of class variable persists across all objects of this class
        @@persons_created += 1
      end  
          
      def how_many_persons
        puts "persons created so far: #{@@persons_created}"
      end 
    end
        
    mark = Person.new("Mark")
    mark.how_many_persons #=> persons created so far: 1
    helen = Person.new("Helen")

    mark.how_many_persons #=> persons created so far: 2
    helen.how_many_persons #=> persons created so far: 2
    # you could either ask mark or helen

Global Variables, preceded by `$`. These are available anywhere to the program, so make sure to use them wisely.

    $total_animals = 0

    class Cat
      def initialize
        $total_animals += 1
      end
    end

    class Dog
      def initialize
        $total_animals += 1
      end
    end

    bob = Cat.new()
    puts $total_animals #=> 1
    fred = Dog.new()
    puts $total_animals #=> 2
