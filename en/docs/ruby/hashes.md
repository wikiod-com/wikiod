A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.  You retrieve or create a new entry in a Hash by referring to its key.

## Syntax
- { first_name: "Noel", second_name: "Edmonds" }

- { :first_name => "Noel", :second_name => "Edmonds" }

- { "First Name" => "Noel", "Second Name" => "Edmonds" }

- { first_key => first_value, second_key => second_value }


Hashes in Ruby map keys to values using a hash table.

Any hashable object can be used as keys. However, it's very common to use a `Symbol` as it is generally more efficient in several Ruby versions, due to the reduced object allocation.

    { key1: "foo", key2: "baz"  }


## Creating a hash
A hash in Ruby is an object that implements a [hash table][1], mapping keys to values. Ruby supports a specific literal syntax for defining hashes using `{}`:

    my_hash = {}  # an empty hash
    grades = { 'Mark' => 15, 'Jimmy' => 10, 'Jack' => 10 }

A hash can also be created using the standard `new` method:

    my_hash = Hash.new  # any empty hash
    my_hash = {}        # any empty hash

Hashes can have values of any type, including complex types like arrays, objects and other hashes:

    mapping = { 'Mark' => 15, 'Jimmy' => [3,4], 'Nika' => {'a' => 3, 'b' => 5} }
    mapping['Mark']   # => 15
    mapping['Jimmy']  # => [3, 4]
    mapping['Nika']   # => {"a"=>3, "b"=>5}

Also keys can be of any type, including complex ones:

    mapping = { 'Mark' => 15, 5 => 10, [1, 2] => 9 }
    mapping['Mark']  # => 15
    mapping[[1, 2]]  # => 9

[Symbols][2] are commonly used as hash keys, and Ruby 1.9 introduced a new syntax specifically to shorten this process. The following hashes are equivalent:

    # Valid on all Ruby versions
    grades = { :Mark => 15, :Jimmy => 10, :Jack => 10 }
    # Valid in Ruby version 1.9+
    grades = { Mark: 15, Jimmy: 10, Jack: 10 }

The following hash (valid in all Ruby versions) is *different*, because all keys are strings:

    grades = { "Mark" => 15, "Jimmy" => 10, "Jack" => 10 }

While both syntax versions can be mixed, the following is discouraged.

    mapping = { :length => 45, width: 10 }

With Ruby 2.2+, there is an alternative syntax for creating a hash with symbol keys (most useful if the symbol contains spaces):

    grades = { "Jimmy Choo": 10, :"Jack Sparrow": 10 }
    # => { :"Jimmy Choo" => 10, :"Jack Sparrow" => 10}

## Setting Default Values
By default, attempting to lookup the value for a key which does not exist will return `nil`. You can optionally specify some other value to return (or an action to take) when the hash is accessed with a non-existent key. Although this is referred to as "the default value", it need not be a single value; it could, for example, be a computed value such as the length of the key.

The default value of a hash can be passed to its constructor:
```
h = Hash.new(0)

h[:hi] = 1 
puts h[:hi]  # => 1 
puts h[:bye] # => 0 returns default value instead of nil
```
A default can also be specified on an already constructed Hash:
```
my_hash = { human: 2, animal: 1 }
my_hash.default = 0
my_hash[:plant] # => 0
```
It is important to note that the **default value is not copied** each time a new key is accessed, which can lead to surprising results when the default value is a reference type:
```
# Use an empty array as the default value
authors = Hash.new([])

# Append a book title 
authors[:homer] << 'The Odyssey'

# All new keys map to a reference to the same array:
authors[:plato] # => ['The Odyssey']
```
To circumvent this problem, the Hash constructor accepts a block which is executed each time a new key is accessed, and the returned value is used as the default:
```
authors = Hash.new { [] }

# Note that we're using += instead of <<, see below
authors[:homer] += ['The Odyssey']
authors[:plato] # => []

authors # => {:homer=>["The Odyssey"]}
```
Note that above we had to use += instead of << because the default value is not automatically assigned to the hash; using << would have added to the array, but authors[:homer] would have remained undefined:
```
authors[:homer] << 'The Odyssey' # ['The Odyssey']
authors[:homer] # => []
authors # => {}
```
In order to be able to assign default values on access, as well as to compute more sophisticated defaults, the default block is passed both the hash and the key:
```
authors = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = [] }

authors[:homer] << 'The Odyssey'
authors[:plato] # => []

authors # => {:homer=>["The Odyssey"], :plato=>[]}
```
You can also use a default block to take an action and/or return a value dependent on the key (or some other data):
```
chars = Hash.new { |hash,key| key.length }

chars[:test] # => 4
```
You can even create more complex hashes:
```
page_views = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = { count: 0, url: key } }
page_views["http://example.com"][:count] += 1
page_views # => {"http://example.com"=>{:count=>1, :url=>"http://example.com"}}
```

In order to set the default to a Proc on an _already-existing_ hash, use `default_proc=`:

```
authors = {}
authors.default_proc = proc { [] }

authors[:homer] += ['The Odyssey']
authors[:plato] # => []

authors # {:homer=>["The Odyssey"]}
```

## Accessing Values
Individual values of a hash are read and written using the `[]` and `[]=` methods:

    my_hash = { length: 4, width: 5 }

    my_hash[:length] #=> => 4
    
    my_hash[:height] = 9
 
    my_hash #=> {:length => 4, :width => 5, :height => 9 }

By default, accessing a key which has not been added to the hash returns `nil`, meaning it is always safe to attempt to look up a key's value:

    my_hash = {}

    my_hash[:age] # => nil

Hashes can also contain keys in strings. If you try to access them normally it will just return a `nil`, instead you access them by their string keys:

```
my_hash = { "name" => "user" }

my_hash[:name]    # => nil
my_hash["name"]   # => user
```

For situations where keys are expected or required to exist, hashes have a `fetch` method which will raise an exception when accessing a key that does not exist:

    my_hash = {}

    my_hash.fetch(:age) #=> KeyError: key not found: :age

`fetch` accepts a default value as its second argument, which is returned if the key has not been previously set:

    my_hash =  {}
    my_hash.fetch(:age, 45) #=> => 45

`fetch` can also accept a block which is returned if the key has not been previously set:

    my_hash = {}
    my_hash.fetch(:age) { 21 } #=> 21

    my_hash.fetch(:age) do |k|
      puts "Could not find #{k}"
    end

    #=> Could not find age

Hashes also support a `store` method as an alias for `[]=`:

    my_hash = {}

    my_hash.store(:age, 45)
    
    my_hash #=> { :age => 45 }

You can also get all values of a hash using the `values` method:

    my_hash = { length: 4, width: 5 }

    my_hash.values #=> [4, 5]

**Note: This is only for Ruby 2.3+** `#dig` is handy for nested `Hash`s. Extracts the nested value specified by the sequence of idx objects by calling dig at each step, returning nil if any intermediate step is nil.

    h = { foo: {bar: {baz: 1}}}
    
    h.dig(:foo, :bar, :baz)   # => 1
    h.dig(:foo, :zot, :xyz)   # => nil
    
    g = { foo: [10, 11, 12] }
    g.dig(:foo, 1)            # => 11

## Automatically creating a Deep Hash
Hash has a default value for keys that are requested but don't exist (nil):

    a = {}
    p a[ :b ] # => nil 

When creating a new Hash, one can specify the default:

    b = Hash.new 'puppy'
    p b[ :b ]            # => 'puppy'

Hash.new also takes a block, which allows you to automatically create nested hashes, such as Perl's autovivification behavior or `mkdir -p`:

    # h is the hash you're creating, and k the key.
    #
    hash = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = Hash.new &h.default_proc }
    hash[ :a ][ :b ][ :c ] = 3

    p hash # => { a: { b: { c: 3 } } }


## Iterating Over a Hash
A `Hash` includes the [`Enumerable`][1] module, which provides several iteration methods, such as: `Enumerable#each`, `Enumerable#each_pair`, `Enumerable#each_key`, and `Enumerable#each_value`.

`.each` and `.each_pair` iterate over each key-value pair:

    h = { "first_name" => "John", "last_name" => "Doe" }
    h.each do |key, value|
        puts "#{key} = #{value}"
    end

    # => first_name = John
    #    last_name = Doe

`.each_key` iterates over the keys only:

    h = { "first_name" => "John", "last_name" => "Doe" }
    h.each_key do |key|
      puts key
    end
    
    # => first_name
    #    last_name

`.each_value` iterates over the values only:

    h = { "first_name" => "John", "last_name" => "Doe" }
    h.each_value do |value|
        puts value
    end
    
    # => John
    #    Doe

`.each_with_index` iterates over the elements and provides the index of the iteration:

    h = { "first_name" => "John", "last_name" => "Doe" }
    h.each_with_index do |(key, value), index|
        puts "index: #{index} | key: #{key} | value: #{value}"
    end

    # => index: 0 | key: first_name | value: John
    #    index: 1 | key: last_name | value: Doe

## Conversion to and from Arrays
Hashes can be freely converted to and from arrays. Converting a hash of key/value pairs into an array will produce an array containing nested arrays for pair:

    { :a => 1, :b => 2 }.to_a # => [[:a, 1], [:b, 2]]

In the opposite direction a Hash can be created from an array of the same format:

    [[:x, 3], [:y, 4]].to_h # => { :x => 3, :y => 4 }


Similarly, Hashes can be initialized using `Hash[]` and a list of alternating keys and values:

    Hash[:a, 1, :b, 2] # => { :a => 1, :b => 2 }

Or from an array of arrays with two values each:

    Hash[ [[:x, 3], [:y, 4]] ] # => { :x => 3, :y => 4 }

Hashes can be converted back to an Array of alternating keys and values using `flatten()`:

    { :a => 1, :b => 2 }.flatten # => [:a, 1, :b, 2]

The easy conversion to and from an array allows `Hash` to work well with many `Enumerable` methods such as `collect` and `zip`:

    Hash[('a'..'z').collect{ |c| [c, c.upcase] }] # => { 'a' => 'A', 'b' => 'B', ... }

    people = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Eve']
    height = [5.7, 6.0, 4.9]
    Hash[people.zip(height)] # => { 'Alice' => 5.7, 'Bob' => '6.0', 'Eve' => 4.9 }


## Filtering hashes
`select` returns a new `hash` with key-value pairs for which the block evaluates to `true`.  

    { :a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3 }.select { |k, v| k != :a && v.even? } # => { :b => 2 }

When you will not need the *key* or *value* in a filter block, the convention is to use an `_` in that place:


    { :a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3 }.select { |_, v| v.even? } # => { :b => 2 }
    { :a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3 }.select { |k, _| k == :c } # => { :c => 3 }

`reject` returns a new `hash` with key-value pairs for which the block evaluates to `false`:

    { :a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3 }.reject { |_, v| v.even? } # => { :a => 1, :c => 3 }
    { :a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3 }.reject { |k, _| k == :b } # => { :a => 1, :c => 3 }

## Getting all keys or values of hash
    {foo: 'bar', biz: 'baz'}.keys   # => [:foo, :biz]
    {foo: 'bar', biz: 'baz'}.values # => ["bar", "baz"]
    {foo: 'bar', biz: 'baz'}.to_a   # => [[:foo, "bar"], [:biz, "baz"]]
    {foo: 'bar', biz: 'baz'}.each   #<Enumerator: {:foo=>"bar", :biz=>"baz"}:each>

## Overriding hash function
Ruby hashes use the methods `hash` and `eql?` to perform the hash operation and assign objects stored in the hash to internal hash bins. The default implementation of `hash` in Ruby is the [murmur hash function][1] [over all member fields of the hashed object][2]. To override this behavior it is possible to override `hash` and `eql?` methods.

As with other hash implementations, two objects a and b, will be hashed to the same bucket if `a.hash == b.hash` and will be deemed identical if `a.eql?(b)`. Thus, when reimplementing `hash` and `eql?` one should take care to ensure that if `a` and `b` are equal under `eql?` they must return the same `hash` value. Otherwise this might result in duplicate entries in a hash. Conversely, a poor choice in `hash` implementation might lead many objects to share the same hash bucket, effectively destroying the O(1) look-up time and causing O(n) for calling `eql?` on all objects. 

In the example below only the instance of class `A` is stored as a key, as it was added first:  

    class A
      def initialize(hash_value)
        @hash_value = hash_value
      end
      def hash
        @hash_value # Return the value given externally
      end
      def eql?(b)
        self.hash == b.hash
      end
    end
    
    class B < A
    end
    
    a = A.new(1)
    b = B.new(1)
    
    h = {}
    h[a] = 1
    h[b] = 2
    
    raise "error" unless h.size == 1
    raise "error" unless h.include? b
    raise "error" unless h.include? a

## Modifying keys and values
You can create a new hash with the keys or values modified, indeed you can also add or delete keys, using [inject](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject) (AKA, [reduce](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-reduce)). For example to produce a hash with stringified keys and upper case values:

```
fruit = { name: 'apple', color: 'green', shape: 'round' }
# => {:name=>"apple", :color=>"green", :shape=>"round"}

new_fruit = fruit.inject({}) { |memo, (k,v)| memo[k.to_s] = v.upcase; memo }

# => new_fruit is {"name"=>"APPLE", "color"=>"GREEN", "shape"=>"ROUND"}
```

Hash is an [enumerable](ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Enumerable.html), in essence a collection of key/value pairs. Therefore is has methods such as `each`, `map` and `inject`.

For every key/value pair in the hash the given block is evaluated, the value of memo on the first run is the seed value passed to `inject`, in our case an empty hash, `{}`. The value of `memo` for subsequent evaluations is the returned value of the previous blocks evaluation, this is why we modify `memo` by setting a key with a value and then return `memo` at the end. The return value of the final blocks evaluation is the return value of `inject`, in our case `memo`.

To avoid the having to provide the final value, you could use [each_with_object](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-each_with_object) instead:

    new_fruit = fruit.each_with_object({}) { |(k,v), memo| memo[k.to_s] = v.upcase }

Or even [map](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-map):

    <!-- if version [gte 1.8] -->
    new_fruit = Hash[fruit.map{ |k,v| [k.to_s, v.upcase] }]
    <!-- end version if -->

(See [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5189259/7948068) for more details, including how to manipulate hashes in place.)




## Set Operations on Hashes
 - **Intersection of Hashes**
    
    To get the intersection of two hashes, return the shared keys the values of which are equal:
    ```
    hash1 = { :a => 1, :b => 2 }
    hash2 = { :b => 2, :c => 3 }
    hash1.select { |k, v| (hash2.include?(k) && hash2[k] == v) } # => { :b => 2 }
    ```
 
 - **Union (merge) of hashes:**

   keys in a hash are unique, if a key occurs in both hashes which are to be merged, the one from the hash that `merge` is called on is overwritten:

    ```
    hash1 = { :a => 1, :b => 2 }
    hash2 = { :b => 4, :c => 3 }

    hash1.merge(hash2) # => { :a => 1, :b => 4, :c => 3 }
    hash2.merge(hash1) # => { :b => 2, :c => 3, :a => 1 }
    ```
