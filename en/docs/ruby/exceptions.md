An _exception_ is an object that represents the occurrence of an exceptional condition. In other words, it indicates that something went wrong.

In Ruby, _exceptions_ are often referred to as _errors_. That's because the base `Exception` class exists as a top-level exception object element, but user-defined execution exceptions are generally `StandardError` or descendants.


## Creating a custom exception type
A custom exception is any class that extends `Exception` or a subclass of `Exception`.

In general, you should always extend `StandardError` or a descendant. The `Exception` family are usually for virtual-machine or system errors, rescuing them can prevent a forced interruption from working as expected.

    # Defines a new custom exception called FileNotFound
    class FileNotFound < StandardError
    end
    
    def read_file(path)
      File.exist?(path) || raise(FileNotFound, "File #{path} not found")
      File.read(path)
    end
    
    read_file("missing.txt")  #=> raises FileNotFound.new("File `missing.txt` not found")
    read_file("valid.txt")    #=> reads and returns the content of the file

It's common to name exceptions by adding the `Error` suffix at the end:

- `ConnectionError`
- `DontPanicError`

However, when the error is self-explanatory, you don't need to add the `Error` suffix because would be redundant:

- `FileNotFound` vs `FileNotFoundError`
- `DatabaseExploded` vs `DatabaseExplodedError`


## Handling multiple exceptions
You can handle multiple errors in the same `rescue` declaration:

    begin
      # an execution that may fail
    rescue FirstError, SecondError => e
      # do something if a FirstError or SecondError occurs
    end

You can also add multiple `rescue` declarations:

    begin
      # an execution that may fail
    rescue FirstError => e
      # do something if a FirstError occurs
    rescue SecondError => e
      # do something if a SecondError occurs
    rescue => e
      # do something if a StandardError occurs
    end

The order of the `rescue` blocks is relevant: the first match is the one executed. Therefore, if you put `StandardError` as the first condition and all your exceptions inherit from `StandardError`, then the other `rescue` statements will never be executed.

    begin
      # an execution that may fail
    rescue => e
      # this will swallow all the errors
    rescue FirstError => e
      # do something if a FirstError occurs
    rescue SecondError => e
      # do something if a SecondError occurs
    end

Some blocks have implicit exception handling like `def`, `class`, and `module`. These blocks allow you to skip the `begin` statement.

    def foo
        ...
    rescue CustomError
        ...
    ensure
        ...
    end

## Handling an exception
Use the `begin/rescue` block to catch (rescue) an exception and handle it:

    begin
      # an execution that may fail
    rescue
      # something to execute in case of failure
    end

A `rescue` clause is analogous to a `catch` block in a curly brace language like C# or Java.

A bare `rescue` like this rescues `StandardError`. 

Note: Take care to avoid catching `Exception` instead of the default `StandardError`. The `Exception` class includes `SystemExit` and `NoMemoryError` and other serious exceptions that you usually don't want to catch. Always consider catching `StandardError` (the default) instead.


You can also specify the exception class that should be rescued:

    begin
      # an excecution that may fail
    rescue CustomError
      # something to execute in case of CustomError
      # or descendant
    end

This rescue clause will not catch any exception that is not a `CustomError`.

You can also store the exception in a specific variable:

    begin
      # an excecution that may fail
    rescue CustomError => error
      # error contains the exception
      puts error.message # provide human-readable details about what went wrong.
      puts error.backtrace.inspect # return an array of strings that represent the call stack
    end

If you failed to handle an exception, you can raise it any time in a rescue block.
 
    begin
       #here goes your code
    rescue => e
        #failed to handle 
        raise e
    end

If you want to retry your `begin` block, call `retry`:

    begin
       #here goes your code
    rescue StandardError => e
       #for some reason you want to retry you code
       retry
    end

You can be stuck in a loop if you catch an exception in every retry. To avoid this, limit your `retry_count` to a certain number of tries.

    retry_count = 0
    begin
          # an excecution that may fail
    rescue
        if retry_count < 5
            retry_count = retry_count + 1
            retry
        else
            #retry limit exceeds, do something else
        end

You can also provide an `else` block or an `ensure` block. An `else` block will be executed when the `begin` block completes without an exception thrown. An `ensure` block will always be executed. An `ensure` block is analogous to a `finally` block in a curly brace language like C# or Java.

    begin
      # an execution that may fail
    rescue
      # something to execute in case of failure
    else
      # something to execute in case of success
    ensure
      # something to always execute
    end

If you are inside a `def`, `module` or `class` block, there is no need to use the begin statement.

    def foo
        ...
    rescue
        ...
    end



## Raising an exception
To raise an exception use `Kernel#raise` passing the exception class and/or message:

    raise StandardError # raises a StandardError.new
    raise StandardError, "An error" # raises a StandardError.new("An error")

You can also simply pass an error message. In this case, the message is wrapped into a `RuntimeError`:

    raise "An error" # raises a RuntimeError.new("An error")

Here's an example:

    def hello(subject)
      raise ArgumentError, "`subject` is missing" if subject.to_s.empty?
      puts "Hello #{subject}"
    end

    hello # => ArgumentError: `subject` is missing
    hello("Simone") # => "Hello Simone"


## Adding information to (custom) exceptions
It may be helpful to include additional information with an exception, e.g. for logging purposes or to allow conditional handling when the exception is caught:

    class CustomError < StandardError
      attr_reader :safe_to_retry

      def initialize(safe_to_retry = false, message = 'Something went wrong')
        @safe_to_retry = safe_to_retry
        super(message)
      end
    end

Raising the exception:

    raise CustomError.new(true)

Catching the exception and accessing the additional information provided:

    begin
      # do stuff
    rescue CustomError => e
      retry if e.safe_to_retry
    end
