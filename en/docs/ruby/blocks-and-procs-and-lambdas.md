## Syntax
- Proc.new(*block*)
- lambda { |args| code }
- ->(arg1, arg2) { code }
- object.to_proc
- { |single_arg| code }
- do |arg, (key, value)|
    *code*
  end

Be careful about operator precedence when you have a line with multiple methods chained, like:

    str = "abcdefg"
    puts str.gsub(/./) do |match|
      rand(2).zero? ? match.upcase : match.downcase
    end

Instead of printing something like `abCDeFg`, like you'd expect, it prints something like `#<Enumerator:0x00000000af42b28>` -- this is because `do ... end` has lower precedence than methods, which means that `gsub` only sees the `/./` argument, and not the block argument. It returns an enumerator. The block ends up passed to `puts`, which ignores it and just displays the result of `gsub(/./)`.

To fix this, either wrap the `gsub` call in parentheses or use `{ ... }` instead.


## Lambdas
<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

    # lambda using the arrow syntax
    hello_world = -> { 'Hello World!' }
    hello_world[]
    # 'Hello World!'

    # lambda using the arrow syntax accepting 1 argument
    hello_world = ->(name) { "Hello #{name}!" }
    hello_world['Sven']
    # "Hello Sven!"

    the_thing = lambda do |magic, ohai, dere|
      puts "magic! #{magic}"
      puts "ohai #{dere}"
      puts "#{ohai} means hello"
    end

    the_thing.call(1, 2, 3)
    # magic! 1
    # ohai 3
    # 2 means hello

    the_thing.call(1, 2)
    # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 3)

    the_thing[1, 2, 3, 4]
    # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (4 for 3)

You can also use `->` to create and `.()` to call lambda

    the_thing = ->(magic, ohai, dere) {
      puts "magic! #{magic}"
      puts "ohai #{dere}"
      puts "#{ohai} means hello"
    }
    
    the_thing.(1, 2, 3)
    # => magic! 1
    # => ohai 3
    # => 2 means hello


Here you can see that a lambda is almost the same as a proc. However, there are several caveats:

- The arity of a lambda's arguments are enforced; passing the wrong number of arguments to a lambda, will raise an `ArgumentError`. They can still have default parameters, splat parameters, etc.

- `return`ing from within a lambda returns from the lambda, while `return`ing from a proc returns out of the enclosing scope:

      def try_proc
        x = Proc.new {
          return # Return from try_proc
        }
        x.call
        puts "After x.call" # this line is never reached
      end

      def try_lambda
        y = -> {
          return # return from y
        }
        y.call
        puts "After y.call" # this line is not skipped
      end

      try_proc # No output
      try_lambda # Outputs "After y.call"



## Partial Application and Currying
Technically, Ruby doesn't have functions, but methods. However, a Ruby method behaves almost identically to functions in other language:

    def double(n)
      n * 2
    end

This normal method/function takes a parameter `n`, doubles it and returns the value. Now let's define a higher order function (or method):

    def triple(n)
      lambda {3 * n}
    end

Instead of returning a number, `triple` returns a method. You can test it using the [Interactive Ruby Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell): 

    $ irb --simple-prompt
    >> def double(n)
    >>   n * 2
    >> end
    => :double
    >> def triple(n)
    >>   lambda {3 * n}
    >> end
    => :triple
    >> double(2)
    => 4
    >> triple(2)
    => #<Proc:0x007fd07f07bdc0@(irb):7 (lambda)>

If you want to actually get the tripled number, you need to call (or "reduce") the lambda:

    triple_two = triple(2)
    triple_two.call # => 6

Or more concisely:

    triple(2).call

## Currying and Partial Applications

This is not useful in terms of defining very basic functionality, but it is useful if you want to have methods/functions that are not instantly called or reduced. For example, let's say you want to define methods that add a number by a specific number (for example `add_one(2) = 3`). If you had to define a ton of these you could do:

    def add_one(n)
      n + 1
    end 
 
    def add_two(n)
      n + 2
    end

 However, you could also do this:

    add = -> (a, b) { a + b }
    add_one = add.curry.(1)
    add_two = add.curry.(2)

Using lambda calculus we can say that `add` is `(λa.(λb.(a+b)))`. Currying is a way of _partially applying_ `add`. So `add.curry.(1)`, is `(λa.(λb.(a+b)))(1)` which can be reduced to `(λb.(1+b))`. Partial application means that we passed one argument to `add` but left the other argument to be supplied later. The output is a specialized method.

## More useful examples of currying

Let's say we have really big general formula, that if we specify certain arguments to it, we can get specific formulae from it. Consider this formula:

    f(x, y, z) = sin(x\*y)*sin(y\*z)*sin(z\*x)

This formula is made for working in three dimensions, but let's say we only want this formula with regards to y and z. Let's also say that to ignore x, we want to set it's value to pi/2. Let's first make the general formula:

    f = ->(x, y, z) {Math.sin(x*y) * Math.sin(y*z) * Math.sin(z*x)}

Now, let's use currying to get our `yz` formula:

    f_yz = f.curry.(Math::PI/2)

Then to call the lambda stored in `f_yz`:

    f_xy.call(some_value_x, some_value_y)

This is pretty simple, but let's say we want to get the formula for `xz`. How can we set `y` to `Math::PI/2` if it's not the last argument? Well, it's a bit more complicated:

    f_xz = -> (x,z) {f.curry.(x, Math::PI/2, z)}

In this case, we need to provide placeholders for the parameter we aren't pre-filling. For consistency we could write `f_xy` like this:

    f_xy = -> (x,y) {f.curry.(x, y, Math::PI/2)}

Here's how the lambda calculus works for `f_yz`:

    f = (λx.(λy.(λz.(sin(x*y) * sin(y*z) * sin(z*x))))
    f_yz = (λx.(λy.(λz.(sin(x*y) * sin(y*z) * sin(z*x)))) (π/2) # Reduce => 
    f_yz = (λy.(λz.(sin((π/2)*y) * sin(y*z) * sin(z*(π/2))))
    
Now let's look at `f_xz`

    f = (λx.(λy.(λz.(sin(x*y) * sin(y*z) * sin(z*x))))
    f_xz = (λx.(λy.(λz.(sin(x*y) * sin(y*z) * sin(z*x)))) (λt.t) (π/2)  # Reduce =>
    f_xz = (λt.(λz.(sin(t*(π/2)) * sin((π/2)*z) * sin(z*t))))

## Objects as block arguments to methods
Putting a `&` (ampersand) in front of an argument will pass it as the method's block. Objects will be converted to a `Proc` using the `to_proc` method.

    class Greeter
      def to_proc
        Proc.new do |item|
          puts "Hello, #{item}"
        end
      end
    end

    greet = Greeter.new

    %w(world life).each(&greet)

This is a common pattern in Ruby and many standard classes provide it.

For example, [`Symbol`][symbol]s implement `to_proc` by sending themselves to the argument:

    # Example implementation
    class Symbol
      def to_proc
        Proc.new do |receiver|
          receiver.send self
        end
      end
    end

This enables the useful `&:symbol` idiom, commonly used with [`Enumerable`][enumerable] objects:

    letter_counts = %w(just some words).map(&:length)  # [4, 4, 5]

[symbol]: http://ruby-doc.org/core/Symbol.html
[enumerable]: http://ruby-doc.org/core/Enumerable.html

## Converting to Proc
Objects that respond to `to_proc` can be converted to procs with the `&` operator (which will also allow them to be passed as blocks).

The class Symbol defines `#to_proc` so it tries to call the corresponding method on the object it receives as parameter.

    p [ 'rabbit', 'grass' ].map( &:upcase ) # => ["RABBIT", "GRASS"]

Method objects also define `#to_proc`.

    output = method( :p )

    [ 'rabbit', 'grass' ].map( &output ) # => "rabbit\ngrass"

 

## Blocks
Blocks are chunks of code enclosed between braces `{}` (usually for single-line blocks) or `do..end` (used for multi-line blocks). 

    5.times { puts "Hello world" } # recommended style for single line blocks
    
    5.times do
        print "Hello "
        puts "world"
    end   # recommended style for multi-line blocks

    5.times {
        print "hello "
        puts "world" } # does not throw an error but is not recommended

Note: braces have higher precedence than `do..end`

Yielding
==========

Blocks can be used inside methods and functions using the word `yield`:

    def block_caller
        puts "some code"
        yield
        puts "other code"
    end
    block_caller { puts "My own block" } # the block is passed as an argument to the method.
    #some code
    #My own block
    #other code

Be careful though if `yield` is called without a block it will raise a `LocalJumpError`. For this purpose ruby provides another method called `block_given?` this allows you to check if a block was passed before calling yield

    def block_caller
      puts "some code" 
      if block_given? 
        yield
      else
        puts "default"
      end
      puts "other code"
    end
    block_caller 
    # some code
    # default
    # other code
    block_caller { puts "not defaulted"}
    # some code
    # not defaulted
    # other code

`yield` can offer arguments to the block as well

    def yield_n(n)
      p = yield n if block_given?
      p || n 
    end
    yield_n(12) {|n| n + 7 } 
    #=> 19 
    yield_n(4) 
    #=> 4

While this is a simple example `yield`ing can be very useful for allowing direct access to instance variables or evaluations inside the context of another object. For Example: 

    class Application
      def configuration
        @configuration ||= Configuration.new
        block_given? ? yield(@configuration) : @configuration
      end
    end
    class Configuration; end

    app = Application.new 
    app.configuration do |config| 
      puts config.class.name
    end
    # Configuration
    #=> nil 
    app.configuration
    #=> #<Configuration:0x2bf1d30>
 
As you can see using `yield` in this manner makes the code more readable than continually calling `app.configuration.#method_name`. Instead you can perform all the configuration inside the block keeping the code contained.

Variables
==========

Variables for blocks are local to the block (similar to the variables of functions), they die when the block is executed.

    my_variable = 8
    3.times do |x|
        my_variable = x 
        puts my_variable
    end
    puts my_variable
    #=> 0
    # 1
    # 2
    # 8

Blocks can't be saved, they die once executed. In order to save blocks you need to use `procs` and `lambdas`. 

## Proc
    def call_the_block(&calling); calling.call; end
    
    its_a = proc do |*args|
      puts "It's a..." unless args.empty?
      "beautiful day"
    end
    
    puts its_a       #=> "beautiful day"
    puts its_a.call  #=> "beautiful day"
    puts its_a[1, 2] #=> "It's a..." "beautiful day"

We've copied the method `call_the_block` from the last example. Here, you can see that a proc is made by calling the `proc` method with a block. You can also see that blocks, like methods, have implicit returns, which means that procs (and lambdas) do too. In the definition of `its_a`, you can see that blocks can take splat arguments as well as normal ones; they're also capable of taking default arguments, but I couldn't think of a way to work that in. Lastly, you can see that it's possible to use multiple syntaxes to call a method -- either the `call` method, or the `[]` operator.
