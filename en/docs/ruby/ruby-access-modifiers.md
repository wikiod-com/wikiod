Access control(scope) to various methods, data members, initialize methods.


## Instance Variables and Class Variables

Let's first brush up with what are the 
**Instance Variables:** They behave more like properties for an object. They are initialized on an object creation.
Instance variables are accessible through instance methods. Per Object has per instance variables. Instance Variables are not shared between objects. 

Sequence class has @from, @to and @by as the instance variables.

    class Sequence
        include Enumerable
    
        def initialize(from, to, by)
            @from = from
            @to = to
            @by = by
        end
    
        def each
            x = @from
            while x < @to
                yield x
                x = x + @by
            end
        end
    
        def *(factor)
            Sequence.new(@from*factor, @to*factor, @by*factor)
        end
    
        def +(offset)
            Sequence.new(@from+offset, @to+offset, @by+offset)
        end
    end
    
    object = Sequence.new(1,10,2)
    object.each do |x|
        puts x
    end
    
    Output:
    1
    3
    5
    7
    9
    
    object1 = Sequence.new(1,10,3)
    object1.each do |x|
        puts x
    end
    
    Output:
    1
    4
    7

**Class Variables**
Treat class variable same as static variables of java, which are shared among the various objects of that class. Class Variables are stored in heap memory.

    class Sequence
        include Enumerable
        @@count = 0
        def initialize(from, to, by)
            @from = from
            @to = to
            @by = by
            @@count = @@count + 1
        end
    
        def each
            x = @from
            while x < @to
                yield x
                x = x + @by
            end
        end
    
        def *(factor)
            Sequence.new(@from*factor, @to*factor, @by*factor)
        end
    
        def +(offset)
            Sequence.new(@from+offset, @to+offset, @by+offset)
        end
    
        def getCount
            @@count
        end
    end
    
    object = Sequence.new(1,10,2)
    object.each do |x|
        puts x
    end
    
    Output:
    1
    3
    5
    7
    9
    
    object1 = Sequence.new(1,10,3)
    object1.each do |x|
        puts x
    end
    
    Output:
    1
    4
    7
    
    puts object1.getCount
    Output: 2
Shared among object and object1.

**Comparing the instance and class variables of Ruby against Java:**

    Class Sequence{
        int from, to, by;
        Sequence(from, to, by){// constructor method of Java is equivalent to initialize method of ruby
            this.from = from;// this.from of java is equivalent to @from indicating currentObject.from
            this.to = to;
            this.by = by;
        }
        public void each(){
            int x = this.from;//objects attributes are accessible in the context of the object.
            while x > this.to
                x = x + this.by
        }
    }

 



## Access Controls
**Comparison of access controls of Java against Ruby:**
If method is declared private in Java, it can only be accessed by other methods within the same class. 
If a method is declared protected it can be accessed by other classes which exist within the same package as well as by subclasses of the class in a different package. 
When a method is public it is visible to everyone. 
In Java, access control visibility concept depends on where these classes lie's in the inheritance/package hierarchy.


**Whereas in Ruby, the inheritance hierarchy or the package/module don't fit.**
**It's all about which object is the receiver of a method**. 

**For a private method in Ruby**, it can never be called with an explicit receiver. We can (only) call the private method with an implicit receiver.

This also means we can call a private method from within a class it is declared in as well as all subclasses of this class.




    class Test1
      def main_method
        method_private
      end
    
      private
      def method_private
        puts "Inside methodPrivate for #{self.class}"
      end
    end
    
    class Test2 < Test1
      def main_method
        method_private
      end
    end
    
    Test1.new.main_method
    Test2.new.main_method
    
    Inside methodPrivate for Test1
    Inside methodPrivate for Test2
    
    class Test3 < Test1
      def main_method
        self.method_private #We were trying to call a private method with an explicit receiver and if called in the same class with self would fail.
      end
    end
    
    Test1.new.main_method
    This will throw NoMethodError

    You can never call the private method from outside the class hierarchy where it was defined.


**Protected method** can be called with an implicit receiver, as like private.
In addition protected method can also be called by an explicit receiver (only) if the receiver is "self" or "an object of the same class".


    class Test1
      def main_method
        method_protected
      end
    
      protected
      def method_protected
        puts "InSide method_protected for #{self.class}"
      end
    end
    
    class Test2 < Test1
      def main_method
        method_protected # called by implicit receiver
      end
    end
    
    class Test3 < Test1
      def main_method
        self.method_protected # called by explicit receiver "an object of the same class"
      end
    end
    
    
    InSide method_protected for Test1
    InSide method_protected for Test2
    InSide method_protected for Test3


    class Test4 < Test1
      def main_method
        Test2.new.method_protected # "Test2.new is the same type of object as self"
      end
    end
    
    Test4.new.main_method

    class Test5
      def main_method
        Test2.new.method_protected
      end
    end
    
    Test5.new.main_method
    This would fail as object Test5 is not subclass of Test1



**Consider Public methods with maximum visibility**



**Summary**

1. **Public:** Public methods have maximum visibility

2. **Protected:** **Protected method** can be called with an implicit receiver, as like private.
In addition protected method can also be called by an explicit receiver (only) if the receiver is "self" or "an object of the same class".

3. **Private:** **For a private method in Ruby**, it can never be called with an explicit receiver. We can (only) call the private method with an implicit receiver.  This also means we can call a private method from within a class it is declared in as well as all subclasses of this class.
