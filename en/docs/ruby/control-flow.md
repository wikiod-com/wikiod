## if, elsif, else and end
Ruby offers the expected `if` and `else` expressions for branching logic, terminated by the `end` keyword:

    # Simulate flipping a coin
    result = [:heads, :tails].sample

    if result == :heads
      puts 'The coin-toss came up "heads"'
    else
      puts 'The coin-toss came up "tails"'
    end

In Ruby, `if` statements are expressions that evaluate to a value, and the result can be assigned to a variable:

    status = if age < 18
               :minor
             else
               :adult
             end

Ruby also offers C-style ternary operators ([see here for details][1]) that can be expressed as:

    some_statement ? if_true : if_false  

This means the above example using if-else can also be written as

    status = age < 18 ? :minor : :adult

Additionally, Ruby offers the `elsif` keyword which accepts an expression to enables additional branching logic:
    
    label = if shirt_size == :s
              'small'
            elsif shirt_size == :m
              'medium'
            elsif shirt_size == :l
              'large'
            else
              'unknown size'
            end

If none of the conditions in an `if`/`elsif` chain are true, and there is no `else` clause, then the expression evaluates to nil.  This can be useful inside string interpolation, since `nil.to_s` is the empty string:

    "user#{'s' if @users.size != 1}"

## Case statement
Ruby uses the `case` keyword for switch statements.

As per the [Ruby Docs](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/keywords/1.9/Object.html#method-i-case):

> Case statements consist of an optional condition, which is in the
> position of an argument to `case`, and zero or more `when` clauses.
> The first `when` clause to match the condition (or to evaluate to
> Boolean truth, if the condition is null) “wins”, and its code stanza
> is executed. The value of the case statement is the value of the
> successful `when` clause, or `nil` if there is no such clause.
> 
> A case statement can end with an `else` clause. Each `when` a
> statement can have multiple candidate values, separated by commas.

Example:

    case x
    when 1,2,3
      puts "1, 2, or 3"
    when 10
      puts "10"
    else
      puts "Some other number"
    end

Shorter version:

    case x
    when 1,2,3 then puts "1, 2, or 3"
    when 10 then puts "10"
    else puts "Some other number"
    end

The value of the `case` clause is matched with each `when` clause using the `===` method (not `==`). Therefore it can be used with a variety of different types of objects.

A `case` statement can be used with [Ranges](http://ruby-doc.org/core/Range.html):

    case 17
    when 13..19
      puts "teenager"
    end


A `case` statement can be used with a [Regexp](http://ruby-doc.org/core/Regexp.html):

    case "google"
    when /oo/
      puts "word contains oo"
    end

A `case` statement can be used with a [Proc](http://ruby-doc.org/core/Proc.html) or lambda:

    case 44
    when -> (n) { n.even? or n < 0 }
      puts "even or less than zero"
    end

A `case` statement can be used with [Classes](http://ruby-doc.org/core/Class.html):

    case x
    when Integer
      puts "It's an integer"
    when String
      puts "It's a string"
    end

By implementing the `===` method you can create your own match classes:

    class Empty
      def self.===(object)
        !object or "" == object
      end
    end
    
    case ""
    when Empty
      puts "name was empty"
    else
      puts "name is not empty"
    end

A `case` statement can be used without a value to match against:

    case
    when ENV['A'] == 'Y'
      puts 'A'
    when ENV['B'] == 'Y'
      puts 'B'
    else
      puts 'Neither A nor B'
    end

A `case` statement has a value, so you can use it as a method argument or in an assignment:

    description = case 16
                  when 13..19 then "teenager"
                  else ""
                  end


## Truthy and Falsy values
In Ruby, there are exactly two values which are considered "falsy", and will return false when tested as a condition for an `if` expression. They are:

- `nil`
- boolean `false`

**All** other values are considered "truthy", including:

- `0` - numeric zero (Integer or otherwise)
- `""` - Empty strings
- `"\n"` - Strings containing only whitespace
- `[]` - Empty arrays
- `{}` - Empty hashes

Take, for example, the following code:
```
def check_truthy(var_name, var)
  is_truthy = var ? "truthy" : "falsy"
  puts "#{var_name} is #{is_truthy}"
end

check_truthy("false", false)
check_truthy("nil", nil)
check_truthy("0", 0)
check_truthy("empty string", "")
check_truthy("\\n", "\n")
check_truthy("empty array", [])
check_truthy("empty hash", {})
```

Will output:
```
false is falsy
nil is falsy
0 is truthy
empty string is truthy
\n is truthy
empty array is truthy
empty hash is truthy
```

## Inline if/unless
A common pattern is to use an inline, or trailing, `if` or `unless`:

    puts "x is less than 5" if x < 5
    
This is known as a conditional *modifier*, and is a handy way of adding simple guard code and early returns:

    def save_to_file(data, filename)
      raise "no filename given" if filename.empty?
      return false unless data.valid?

      File.write(filename, data)
    end

It is not possible to add an `else` clause to these modifiers. Also it is generally not recommended to use conditional modifiers inside the main logic -- For complex code one should use normal `if`, `elsif`, `else` instead.

## while, until
A `while` loop executes the block while the given condition is met:

    i = 0
    while i < 5
      puts "Iteration ##{i}"
      i +=1
    end

An `until` loop executes the block while the conditional is false:

    i = 0
    until i == 5
      puts "Iteration ##{i}"
      i +=1
    end

## Or-Equals/Conditional assignment operator (||=)
Ruby has an or-equals operator that allows a value to be assigned to a variable if and only if that variable evaluates to either `nil` or `false`.

     ||= # this is the operator that achieves this. 

this operator with the double pipes representing or and the equals sign representing assigning of a value. You may think it represents something like this:
     
     x = x || y

this above example is not correct. The or-equals operator actually represents this:
     
     x || x = y

If `x` evaluates to `nil` or `false` then `x` is assigned the value of `y`, and left unchanged otherwise.

Here is a practical use-case of the or-equals operator. Imagine you have a portion of your code that is expected to send an email to a user. What do you do if for what ever reason there is no email for this user. You might write something like this:

     if user_email.nil?
        user_email = "error@yourapp.com"
     end

Using the or-equals operator we can cut this entire chunk of code, providing clean, clear control and functionality. 

     user_email ||= "error@yourapp.com"

In cases where `false` is a valid value, care must be taken to not override it accidentally:

    has_been_run = false
    has_been_run ||= true
    #=> true

    has_been_run = false
    has_been_run = true if has_been_run.nil?
    #=> false

## Flip-Flop operator
The flip flop operator `..` is used between two conditions in a conditional statement:

    (1..5).select do |e|
      e if (e == 2) .. (e == 4)
    end
    # => [2, 3, 4]

The condition evaluates to `false` *until* the first part becomes `true`. Then it evaluates to `true` *until* the second part becomes `true`. After that it switches to `false` again.

This example illustrates what is being selected:

    [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5].select do |e|
      e if (e == 2) .. (e == 4)
    end
    # => [2, 2, 3, 4]

The flip-flop operator only works inside ifs (including `unless`) and ternary operator. Otherwise it is being considered as the range operator.

    (1..5).select do |e|
      (e == 2) .. (e == 4)
    end
    # => ArgumentError: bad value for range
    
It can switch from `false` to `true` and backwards multiple times:

    ((1..5).to_a * 2).select do |e|
      e if (e == 2) .. (e == 4)
    end
    # => [2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4] 

## unless
A common statement is `if !(some condition)`. Ruby offers the alternative of the `unless` statement. 

The structure is exactly the same as an `if` statement, except the condition is negative. Also, the `unless` statement does not support `elsif`, but it does support `else`:

    # Prints not inclusive
    unless 'hellow'.include?('all')
      puts 'not inclusive'
    end

## throw, catch
Unlike many other programming languages, the `throw` and `catch` keywords are not related to exception handling in Ruby.

In Ruby, `throw` and `catch` act a bit like labels in other languages. They are used to change the control flow, but are not related to a concept of "error" like Exceptions are.

    catch(:out) do
      catch(:nested) do
        puts "nested"
      end

      puts "before"
      throw :out
      puts "will not be executed"
    end
    puts "after"
    # prints "nested", "before", "after"

## Ternary operator
Ruby has a ternary operator (`?:`), which returns one of two value based on if a condition evaluates as truthy:

    conditional ? value_if_truthy : value_if_falsy

    value = true
    value ? "true" : "false"
    #=> "true"

    value = false
    value ? "true" : "false"
    #=> "false"

it is the same as writing `if a then b else c end`, though the ternary is preferred

Examples:

    puts (if 1 then 2 else 3 end) # => 2

    puts 1 ? 2 : 3                # => 2

    x = if 1 then 2 else 3 end
    puts x                        # => 2

## Loop control with break, next, and redo
The flow of execution of a Ruby block may be controlled with the `break`, `next`, and `redo` statements.

## `break`
The `break` statement will exit the block immediately.  Any remaining instructions in the block will be skipped, and the iteration will end:

    actions = %w(run jump swim exit macarena)
    index = 0
    
    while index < actions.length
      action = actions[index]
    
      break if action == "exit"
    
      index += 1
      puts "Currently doing this action: #{action}"
    end
    
    # Currently doing this action: run
    # Currently doing this action: jump
    # Currently doing this action: swim

## `next`
The `next` statement will return to the top of the block immediately, and proceed with the next iteration.  Any remaining instructions in the block will be skipped:

    actions = %w(run jump swim rest macarena)
    index = 0
    
    while index < actions.length
      action = actions[index]
      index += 1
    
      next if action == "rest"
    
      puts "Currently doing this action: #{action}"
    end
    
    # Currently doing this action: run
    # Currently doing this action: jump
    # Currently doing this action: swim
    # Currently doing this action: macarena

## `redo`
The `redo` statement will return to the top of the block immediately, and retry the same iteration.  Any remaining instructions in the block will be skipped:

    actions = %w(run jump swim sleep macarena)
    index = 0
    repeat_count = 0
    
    while index < actions.length
      action = actions[index]
      puts "Currently doing this action: #{action}"
    
      if action == "sleep"
        repeat_count += 1
        redo if repeat_count < 3
      end
    
      index += 1
    end
    
    # Currently doing this action: run
    # Currently doing this action: jump
    # Currently doing this action: swim
    # Currently doing this action: sleep
    # Currently doing this action: sleep
    # Currently doing this action: sleep
    # Currently doing this action: macarena

## `Enumerable` iteration
In addition to loops, these statements work with Enumerable iteration methods, such as `each` and `map`:

    [1, 2, 3].each do |item|
      next if item.even?
      puts "Item: #{item}"
    end
    
    # Item: 1
    # Item: 3

## Block result values
In both the `break` and `next` statements, a value may be provided, and will be used as a block result value:

    even_value = for value in [1, 2, 3]
      break value if value.even?
    end
    
    puts "The first even value is: #{even_value}"
    
    # The first even value is: 2


## return vs. next: non-local return in a block
Consider this *broken* snippet:

    def foo
      bar = [1, 2, 3, 4].map do |x|
        return 0 if x.even?
        x
      end
      puts 'baz'
      bar
    end
    foo # => 0

One might expect `return` to yield a value for `map`'s array of block results. So the return value of `foo` would be `[1, 0, 3, 0]`. Instead, **`return` returns a value from the method `foo`**. Notice that `baz` isn't printed, which means execution never reached that line.

`next` with a value does the trick. It acts as a block-level `return`.

    def foo
      bar = [1, 2, 3, 4].map do |x|
        next 0 if x.even?
        x
      end
      puts 'baz'
      bar
    end
    foo # baz
        # => [1, 0, 3, 0]

In the absence of a `return`, the value returned by the block is the value of its last expression.

## Control flow with logic statements
While it might seem counterintuitive, you can use logical operators to determine whether or not a statement is run. For instance:

```
File.exist?(filename) or STDERR.puts "#{filename} does not exist!"
```

This will check to see if the file exists and only print the error message if it doesn't. The `or` statement is lazy, which means it'll stop executing once it's sure which whether it's value is true or false. As soon as the first term is found to be true, there's no need to check the value of the other term. But if the first term is false, it must check the second term.

A common use is to set a default value:

```
glass = glass or 'full' # Optimist! 
```

That sets the value of `glass` to 'full' if it's not already set. More concisely, you can use the symbolic version of `or`:

```
glass ||= 'empty' # Pessimist. 
```

It's also possible to run the second statement only if the first one is false:

```
File.exist?(filename) and puts "#{filename} found!"
```

Again, `and` is lazy so it will only execute the second statement if necessary to arrive at a value.

The `or` operator has lower precedence than `and`. Similarly, `||` has lower precedence than `&&`. The symbol forms have higher precedence than the word forms. This is handy to know when you want to mix this technique with assignment:

```
a = 1 and b = 2
#=> a==1
#=> b==2
```

```
a = 1 && b = 2; puts a, b
#=> a==2
#=> b==2
```

Note that the Ruby Style Guide [recommends](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#no-and-or-or):

> The `and` and `or` keywords are banned. The minimal added readability is just not worth the high probability of introducing subtle bugs. For boolean expressions, always use `&&` and `||` instead. For flow control, use `if` and `unless`; `&&` and `||` are also acceptable but less clear. 

## begin, end
The `begin` block is a control structure that groups together multiple statements.

    begin
      a = 7
      b = 6
      a * b
    end

A `begin` block will return the value of the last statement in the block.  The following example will return `3`.

    begin
      1
      2
      3
    end


The `begin` block is useful for conditional assignment using the `||=` operator where multiple statements may be required to return a result.

    circumference ||=
      begin
        radius = 7
        tau = Math::PI * 2
        tau * radius
      end


It can also be combined with other block structures such as `rescue`, `ensure`, `while`, `if`, `unless`, etc to provide greater control of program flow.

`Begin` blocks are not code blocks, like `{ ... }` or `do ... end`; they cannot be passed to functions.
