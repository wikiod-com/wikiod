## Syntax
- class SubClass < SuperClass

## Subclasses
Inheritance allows classes to define specific behaviour based on an existing class.

    class Animal
      def say_hello
        'Meep!'
      end

      def eat
        'Yumm!'
      end
    end

    class Dog < Animal
      def say_hello
        'Woof!'
      end
    end

    spot = Dog.new
    spot.say_hello # 'Woof!'
    spot.eat       # 'Yumm!'

In this example:
* `Dog` Inherits from `Animal`, making it a *Subclass*.
* `Dog` gains both the `say_hello` and `eat` methods from `Animal`.
* `Dog` overrides the `say_hello` method with different functionality.

## Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance is a feature that allows one class to inherit from multiple classes(i.e., more than one parent). Ruby does not support multiple inheritance. It only supports single-inheritance (i.e. class can have only one parent), but you can use *composition* to build more complex classes using [Modules](https://www.wikiod.com/ruby/modules).

## What is inherited?
**Methods are inherited**

    class A
      def boo; p 'boo' end
    end

    class B < A; end

    b = B.new
    b.boo # => 'boo'

**Class methods are inherited**

    class A
      def self.boo; p 'boo' end
    end

    class B < A; end

    p B.boo # => 'boo'

**Constants are inherited**

    class A
      WOO = 1
    end

    class B < A; end

    p B::WOO # => 1

But beware, they can be overridden:

    class B
      WOO = WOO + 1
    end

    p B::WOO # => 2

**Instance variables are inherited:**

    class A
      attr_accessor :ho
      def initialize
        @ho = 'haha'
      end
    end
    
    class B < A; end
    
    b = B.new
    p b.ho # => 'haha'

Beware, if you override the methods that initialize instance variables without calling `super`, they will be nil. Continuing from above:

    class C < A
      def initialize; end
     end
    
    c = C.new
    p c.ho    # => nil


**Class instance variables are not inherited:**

    class A
        @foo = 'foo'
        class << self
            attr_accessor :foo
        end
    end

    class B < A; end

    p B.foo # => nil

    # The accessor is inherited, since it is a class method
    #
    B.foo = 'fob' # possible

**Class variables aren't really inherited**

They are shared between the base class and all subclasses as 1 variable:

    class A
        @@foo = 0
        def initialize
            @@foo  += 1 
            p @@foo
        end
    end
    
    class B < A;end
    
    a = A.new # => 1
    b = B.new # => 2

So continuing from above:
    
    class C < A
      def initialize
        @@foo = -10
        p @@foo
      end
    end
    
    a = C.new # => -10
    b = B.new # => -9

## Mixins
[Mixins][1] are a beautiful way to achieve something similar to multiple inheritance. It allows us to inherit or rather include methods defined in a module into a class. These methods can be included as either instance or class methods. The below example depicts this design.

    module SampleModule
    
      def self.included(base)
        base.extend ClassMethods
      end
    
      module ClassMethods
    
        def method_static
          puts "This is a static method"
        end
    
      end
    
      def insta_method
        puts "This is an instance method"
      end
    
    end
    
    class SampleClass
      include SampleModule
    end
    
    sc = SampleClass.new
    
    sc.insta_method
    
    prints "This is an instance method"
    
    sc.class.method_static
    
    prints "This is a static method"

## Refactoring existing classes to use Inheritance
Let's say we have two classes, `Cat` and `Dog`.

<!-- language: lang-ruby -->

```
class Cat
  def eat
    die unless has_food?
    self.food_amount -= 1
    self.hungry = false
  end
  def sound
    puts "Meow"
  end
end

class Dog
  def eat
    die unless has_food?
    self.food_amount -= 1
    self.hungry = false
  end
  def sound
    puts "Woof"
  end
end
```

The `eat` method is exactly the same in these two classes. While this works, it is hard to maintain. The problem will get worse if there are more animals with the same `eat` method. Inheritance can solve this problem.

```
class Animal
  def eat
    die unless has_food?
    self.food_amount -= 1
    self.hungry = false
  end
  # No sound method
end

class Cat < Animal
  def sound
    puts "Meow"
  end
end

class Dog < Animal
  def sound
    puts "Woof"
  end
end
```

We have created a new class, `Animal`, and moved our `eat` method to that class. Then, we  made `Cat` and `Dog` inherit from this new common superclass. This removes the need for repeating code
