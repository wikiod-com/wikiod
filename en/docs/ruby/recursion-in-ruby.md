## Tail recursion
Many recursive algorithms can be expressed using iteration. For instance, the greatest common denominator function can be [written recursively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)#Recursive_procedures):

    def gdc (x, y)
      return x if y == 0
      return gdc(y, x%y)
    end

or iteratively:

    def gdc_iter (x, y)
      while y != 0 do
        x, y = y, x%y
      end
    
      return x
    end

The two algorithms are equivalent in theory, but the recursive version risks a [SystemStackError](https://ruby-doc.org/core/SystemStackError.html). However, since the recursive method ends with a call to itself, it could be optimized to avoid a stack overflow. Another way to put it: the recursive algorithm can result in the same machine code as the iterative _if_ the compiler knows to look for the recursive method call at the end of the method. Ruby doesn't do tail call optimization by default, but you can [turn it on with](https://ruby-doc.org/core/RubyVM/InstructionSequence.html#method-c-compile_option):

    RubyVM::InstructionSequence.compile_option = {
      tailcall_optimization: true,
      trace_instruction: false
    }

In addition to turning on tail-call optimization, you also need to turn off instruction tracing. Unfortunately, these options only apply at compile time, so you either need to `require` the recursive method from another file or `eval` the method definition:

    RubyVM::InstructionSequence.new(<<-EOF).eval
      def me_myself_and_i
        me_myself_and_i
      end
    EOF
    me_myself_and_i # Infinite loop, not stack overflow

Finally, the final return call must return the method and _only the method_. That means you'll need to re-write the standard factorial function:

    def fact(x)
      return 1 if x <= 1
      return x*fact(x-1)
    end

To something like:

     def fact(x, acc=1)
       return acc if x <= 1
       return fact(x-1, x*acc)
     end

This version passes the accumulated sum via a second (optional) argument that [defaults](https://www.wikiod.com/ruby/methods#Default parameters) to 1.

## Recursive function
Let's start with a simple algorithm to see how recursion could be implemented in Ruby. 

A bakery has products to sell. Products are in packs. It services orders in packs only. Packaging starts from the largest pack size and then the remaining quantities are filled by next pack sizes available. 

For e.g. If an order of 16 is received, bakery allocates 2 from 5 pack and 2 from 3 pack. 2*5+2*3 = 16. Let's see how this is implemented in recursion. "allocate" is the recursive function here.

    #!/usr/bin/ruby
    
    class Bakery
      attr_accessor :selected_packs
    
      def initialize
        @packs = [5,3] # pack sizes 5 and 3
        @selected_packs = []
      end
    
      def allocate(qty)
        remaining_qty = nil
    
        # ==============================================
        # packs are allocated in large packs first order
        # to minimize the packaging space
        # ==============================================
        @packs.each do |pack|
          remaining_qty = qty - pack
    
          if remaining_qty > 0
            ret_val = allocate(remaining_qty)
            if ret_val == 0
              @selected_packs << pack
              remaining_qty = 0
              break
            end
          elsif remaining_qty == 0
            @selected_packs << pack
            break
          end
        end
    
        remaining_qty
      end
    end
    
    bakery = Bakery.new
    bakery.allocate(16)
    puts "Pack combination is: #{bakery.selected_packs.inspect}"

Output is:
> Pack combination is: [3, 3, 5, 5]
