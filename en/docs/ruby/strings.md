## Syntax
- 'A string' // creates a string via single-quoted literal
- "A string" // creates a string via double-quoted literal
- String.new("A string")
- %q(A string) // alternative syntax for creating single quoted strings
- %Q(A string) // alternative syntax for creating double quoted strings

## Difference between single-quoted and double-quoted String literals
The main difference is that double-quoted `String` literals support string interpolations and the full set of escape sequences.

For instance, they can include arbitrary Ruby expressions via interpolation:

    # Single-quoted strings don't support interpolation
    puts 'Now is #{Time.now}'
    # Now is #{Time.now}

    # Double-quoted strings support interpolation
    puts "Now is #{Time.now}"
    # Now is 2016-07-21 12:43:04 +0200

Double-quoted strings also support the [entire set of escape sequences](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/doc/syntax/literals.rdoc#strings) including `"\n"`, `"\t"`...

    puts 'Hello\nWorld'
    # Hello\nWorld
    
    puts "Hello\nWorld"
    # Hello
    # World

... while single-quoted strings support *no* escape sequences, baring the minimal set necessary for single-quoted strings to be useful: Literal single quotes and backslashes, `'\''` and `'\\'` respectively.

## Creating a String
Ruby provides several ways to create a [`String`](http://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html) object. The most common way is using single or double quotes to create a "[string literal](http://ruby-doc.org/core/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Strings)":

    s1 = 'Hello'
    s2 = "Hello"

The main difference is that double-quoted string literals are a little bit more flexible as they support interpolation and some backslash escape sequences.

There are also several other possible ways to create a string literal using arbitrary string delimiters. An arbitrary string delimiter is a `%` followed by a matching pair of delimiters:

    %(A string)
    %{A string}
    %<A string>
    %|A string|
    %!A string!

Finally, you can use the `%q` and `%Q` sequence, that are equivalent to `'` and `"`":

    puts %q(A string)
    # A string
    puts %q(Now is #{Time.now})
    # Now is #{Time.now}

    puts %Q(A string)
    # A string
    puts %Q(Now is #{Time.now})
    # Now is 2016-07-21 12:47:45 +0200

`%q` and `%Q` sequences are useful when the string contains either single quotes, double quotes, or a mix of both. In this way, you don't need to escape the content:

    %Q(<a href="/profile">User's profile<a>)

You can use several different delimiters, as long as there is a matching pair:

    %q(A string)
    %q{A string}
    %q<A string>
    %q|A string|
    %q!A string!


## Case manipulation

    "string".upcase     # => "STRING"
    "STRING".downcase   # => "string"
    "String".swapcase   # => "sTRING"
    "string".capitalize # => "String"

These four methods do not modify the original receiver. For example, 

    str = "Hello"
    str.upcase # => "HELLO"
    puts str   # => "Hello"

There are four similar methods that perform the same actions but modify original receiver.

    "string".upcase!     # => "STRING"
    "STRING".downcase!   # => "string"
    "String".swapcase!   # => "sTRING"
    "string".capitalize! # => "String"

For example, 

    str = "Hello"
    str.upcase!  # => "HELLO"
    puts str     # => "HELLO"

Notes:
- prior to Ruby 2.4 these methods do not handle unicode.

## String concatenation
Concatenate strings with the `+` operator:

    s1 = "Hello"
    s2 = " "
    s3 = "World"
    
    puts s1 + s2 + s3
    # => Hello World
    
    s = s1 + s2 + s3
    puts s
    # => Hello World

Or with the `<<` operator:

    s = 'Hello'
    s << ' '
    s << 'World'
    puts s
    # => Hello World

Note that the `<<` operator modifies the object on the left hand side.  

You also can multiply strings, e.g.

    "wow" * 3
    # => "wowwowwow"

## Splitting a String
`String#split` splits a `String` into an `Array`, based on a delimiter.

    "alpha,beta".split(",")
    # => ["alpha", "beta"]

An empty `String` results into an empty `Array`:

    "".split(",")
    # => []

A non-matching delimiter results in an `Array` containing a single item:

    "alpha,beta".split(".")
    # => ["alpha,beta"]

You can also split a string using regular expressions:

    "alpha, beta,gamma".split(/, ?/)
    # => ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]

The delimiter is optional, by default a string is split on whitespace:
    
    "alpha beta".split
    # => ["alpha", "beta"] 

## Positioning strings
In Ruby, strings can be left-justified, right-justified or centered

To left-justify  string, use the `ljust` method. This takes in two parameters, an integer representing the number of characters of the new string and a string, representing the pattern to be filled. 

If the integer is greater than the length of the original string, the new string will be left-justified with the optional string parameter taking the remaining space. If the string parameter is not given, the string will be padded with spaces.

    str ="abcd"
    str.ljust(4)          => "abcd"
    str.ljust(10)         => "abcd      "

To right-justify a string, use the `rjust` method. This takes in two parameters, an integer representing the number of characters of the new string and a string, representing the pattern to be filled. 

If the integer is greater than the length of the original string, the new string will be right-justified with the optional string parameter taking the remaining space. If the string parameter is not given, the string will be padded with spaces.

    str = "abcd"
    str.rjust(4)          => "abcd"
    str.rjust(10)         => "      abcd"

To center a string, use the `center` method. This takes in two parameters, an integer representing the width of the new string and a string, which the original string will be padded with. The string will be aligned to the center.

    str = "abcd"
    str.center(4)          => "abcd"
    str.center(10)         => "   abcd   "

## Joining Strings
`Array#join` joins an `Array` into a `String`, based on a delimiter:

    ["alpha", "beta"].join(",")
    # => "alpha,beta"

The delimiter is optional, and defaults to an empty `String`.

    ["alpha", "beta"].join
    # => "alphabeta"

An empty `Array` results in an empty `String`, no matter which delimiter is used.

    [].join(",")
    # => ""



## String starts with
To find if a string starts with a pattern, the `start_with?` method comes in handy

    str = "zebras are cool"
    str.start_with?("zebras")      => true

You can also check the position of the pattern with `index`

    str = "zebras are cool"
    str.index("zebras").zero?      => true

## String interpolation
The double-quoted delimiter `"` and `%Q` sequence supports string interpolation using `#{ruby_expression}`:

    puts "Now is #{Time.now}"
    # Now is Now is 2016-07-21 12:47:45 +0200

    puts %Q(Now is #{Time.now})
    # Now is Now is 2016-07-21 12:47:45 +0200



## String ends with
To find if a string ends with a pattern, the `end_with?` method comes in handy

    str = "I like pineapples"
    str.end_with?("pineaaples")      => false

## Multiline strings
The easiest way to create a multiline string is to just use multiple lines between quotation marks:

    address = "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this
    continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the
    proposition that all men are created equal."

The main problem with that technique is that if the string includes a quotation, it'll break the string syntax. To work around the problem, you can use a [heredoc](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Here+Documents) instead:

    puts <<-RAVEN
      Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, 
      Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— 
          While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, 
      As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. 
      "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door— 
                  Only this and nothing more." 
      RAVEN

Ruby supports shell-style here documents with `<<EOT`, but the terminating text must start the line. That screws up code indentation, so there's not a lot of reason to use that style. Unfortunately, the string will have indentations depending no how the code itself is indented.

Ruby 2.3 solves the problem by introducing `<<~` which strips out excess leading spaces:

    <!-- if version [gte 2.3] -->
    def build_email(address)
      return (<<~EMAIL)
        TO: #{address}
    
        To Whom It May Concern:
    
        Please stop playing the bagpipes at sunrise!
                         
        Regards,
        Your neighbor               
      EMAIL
    end
    <!-- end version if -->

[Percent Strings](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/doc/syntax/literals_rdoc.html#label-Percent+Strings) also work to create multiline strings:

    %q(
    HAMLET        Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
    POLONIUS        By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
    HAMLET        Methinks it is like a weasel.
    POLONIUS        It is backed like a weasel.
    HAMLET        Or like a whale?
    POLONIUS        Very like a whale
    )

There are a few ways to avoid interpolation and escape sequences:

* Single quote instead of double quote: `'\n is a carriage return.'`
* Lower case `q` in a percent string: `%q[#{not-a-variable}]`
* Single quote the terminal string in a heredoc:

      <<-'CODE'
         puts 'Hello world!'
      CODE

## Formatted strings
Ruby can inject an array of values into a string by replacing any placeholders with the values from the supplied array.

    "Hello %s, my name is %s!" % ['World', 'br3nt']
    # => Hello World, my name is br3nt!

The place holders are represented by two `%s` and the values are supplied by the array `['Hello', 'br3nt']`.  The `%` operator instructs the string to inject the values of the array.

## String character replacements
The `tr` method returns a copy of a string where the characters of the first argument are replaced by the characters of the second argument.

    "string".tr('r', 'l') # => "stling"


To replace only the first occurrence of a pattern with with another expression use the `sub` method

    "string ring".sub('r', 'l') # => "stling ring"

If you would like to replace _all_ occurrences of a pattern with that expression use `gsub`

    "string ring".gsub('r','l') # => "stling ling" 

To delete characters, pass in an empty string for the second parameter

You can also use regular expressions in all these methods.

It's important to note that these methods will only return a new copy of a string and won't modify the string in place. To do that, you need to use the `tr!`, `sub!` and `gsub!` methods respectively.

## Understanding the data in a string
In Ruby, a string is just a sequence of [bytes][1] along with the name of an encoding (such as `UTF-8`, `US-ASCII`, `ASCII-8BIT`) that specifies how you might interpret those bytes as characters.
 
Ruby strings can be used to hold text (basically a sequence of characters), in which case the UTF-8 encoding is usually used.
 
    "abc".bytes  # => [97, 98, 99]
    "abc".encoding.name  # => "UTF-8"
 
Ruby strings can also be used to hold binary data (a sequence of bytes), in which case the ASCII-8BIT encoding is usually used.
 
    [42].pack("i").encoding  # => "ASCII-8BIT"
 
It is possible for the sequence of bytes in a string to not match the encoding, resulting in errors if you try to use the string.
 
    "\xFF \xFF".valid_encoding? # => false
    "\xFF \xFF".split(' ')      # ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8

## String Substitution
```
p "This is %s" % "foo"
# => "This is foo"

p "%s %s %s" % ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
# => "foo bar baz"

p "%{foo} == %{foo}" % {:foo => "foo" }
# => "foo == foo"
```
