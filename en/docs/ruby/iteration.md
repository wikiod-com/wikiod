## Each
Ruby has many types of enumerators but the first and most simple type of enumerator to start with is ``each``. We will print out `even` or `odd` for each number between `1` and `10` to show how `each` works.

Basically there are two ways to pass so called `blocks`. A `block` is a piece of code being passed which will be executed by the method which is called. The `each` method takes a `block` which it calls for every element of the collection of objects it was called on.

There are two ways to pass a block to a method:

## Method 1: Inline
```ruby
(1..10).each { |i| puts i.even? ? 'even' : 'odd' }
```
This is a very compressed and _ruby_ way to solve this. Let's break this down piece by piece.
1. `(1..10)` is a range from `1` to `10` inclusive. If we wanted it to be `1` to `10` exclusive, we would write `(1...10)`.
2. `.each` is an enumerator that enumerates over `each` element in the object it is acting on. In this case, it acts on `each` number in the range.
3. `{ |i| puts i.even? ? 'even' : 'odd' }` is the block for the `each` statement, which itself can be broken down further.
    1. `|i|` this means that each element in the range is represented within the block by the identifier `i`. 
    2. `puts` is an output method in Ruby that has an automatic line break after each time it prints. (We can use `print` if we don't want the automatic line break)
    3. `i.even?` checks if `i` is even. We could have also used `i % 2 == 0`; however, it is preferable to use built in methods.
    4. ` ? "even" : "odd" ` this is ruby's ternary operator. The way a ternary operator is constructed is `expression ? a : b`. This is short for
    ```ruby
    if expression
      a
    else
      b
    end
    ```
    
For code longer than one line the `block` should be passed as a `multiline block`.
## Method 2: Multiline
```ruby
(1..10).each do |i|
  if i.even?
    puts 'even'
  else
    puts 'odd'
  end
end
```

In a `multiline block` the `do` replaces the opening bracket and `end` replaces the closing bracket from the `inline` style.


Ruby supports reverse_each as well. It will iterate the array backwards.

    @arr = [1,2,3,4]
    puts @arr.inspect # output is [1,2,3,4]
    
    print "Reversed array elements["
    @arr.reverse_each do |val|
            print " #{val} " # output is 4 3 2 1
    end
    print "]\n"

## Implementation in a class


## Iterating over complex objects
**Arrays**

You can iterate over nested arrays:

    [[1, 2], [3, 4]].each { |(a, b)| p "a: #{ a }", "b: #{ b }" }

The following syntax is allowed too:

    [[1, 2], [3, 4]].each { |a, b| "a: #{ a }", "b: #{ b }" }

Will produce:

    "a: 1"
    "b: 2"
    "a: 3"
    "b: 4"

**Hashes**

You can iterate over key-value pairs:

    {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}.each { |pair| p "pair: #{ pair }" }

Will produce:

    "pair: [:a, 1]"
    "pair: [:b, 2]"
    "pair: [:c, 3]"

You can iterate over keys and values simultaneously:

    {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}.each { |(k, v)| p "k: #{ k }", "v: #{ k }" }

Will produce:

    "k: a"
    "v: a"
    "k: b"
    "v: b"
    "k: c"
    "v: c"

## For  iterator
This iterates from 4 to 13 (inclusive).
 
    for i in 4..13
        puts "this is #{i}.th number"
    end

We can also iterate over arrays using for

    names = ['Siva', 'Charan', 'Naresh', 'Manish']
    
    for name in names
        puts name
    end

## Iteration with index
Sometimes you want to know the position (**index**) of the current element while iterating over an enumerator. For such purpose, Ruby provides the `with_index` method. It can be applied to all the enumerators. Basically, by adding `with_index` to an enumeration, you can enumerate that enumeration. Index is passed to a block as the second argument. 

    [2,3,4].map.with_index { |e, i| puts "Element of array number #{i} => #{e}" }
    #Element of array number 0 => 2
    #Element of array number 1 => 3
    #Element of array number 2 => 4
    #=> [nil, nil, nil]

`with_index` has an optional argument â€“ the first index which is `0` by default:
    
    [2,3,4].map.with_index(1) { |e, i| puts "Element of array number #{i} => #{e}" }
    #Element of array number 1 => 2
    #Element of array number 2 => 3
    #Element of array number 3 => 4
    #=> [nil, nil, nil]

There is a specific method `each_with_index`. The only difference between it and `each.with_index` is that you can't pass an argument to that, so the first index is `0` all the time.

    [2,3,4].each_with_index { |e, i| puts "Element of array number #{i} => #{e}" }
    #Element of array number 0 => 2
    #Element of array number 1 => 3
    #Element of array number 2 => 4
    #=> [2, 3, 4]

## Map
Returns the changed object, but the original object remains as it was. For example:

    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    arr.map { |i| i + 1 } # => [2, 3, 4]
    arr # => [1, 2, 3]

`map!` changes the original object:

    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    arr.map! { |i| i + 1 } # => [2, 3, 4]
    arr # => [2, 3, 4]

Note: you can also use `collect` to do the same thing.
