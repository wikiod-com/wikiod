[Ruby][1] is a multi-platform open-source, dynamic object-oriented interpreted language, designed to be simplistic and productive. It was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz) in 1995.

>According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by [Perl][2], [Smalltalk][3], [Eiffel][4], [Ada][5], and [Lisp][6]. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
