[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is written entirely in JavaScript, and allows to install and distribute mostly JavaScript modules on the registry. Packages are treated in the [CommonJS][1] format, and are recognizable by the presence of a [`package.json` file][2].
