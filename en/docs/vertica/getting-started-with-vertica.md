## Installation or Setup
**Operational System Setup**
(Linux-CentOS x64 or RedHat x64)

 **1-Increase the swap space to a minimum of 2 Gb**
 
 **2-Space and CPU requirements:**
  

-Vertica requires at least 1 GB per CPU.

-disk utilization per node should no more than sixty percent (60%). Disk space is temporarily required by certain query execution operators, such as hash joins and sorts, in the case when they have to spill to disk.

-configure TEMP SPACE separate from data disk space.
 

**3-Install the prerequisite for Vertica Cluster**

 

    yum install  rsync  python*  telnet ruby*  java* sudo  openssh-server openssh-clients
    chkconfig sshd on
    service sshd start



 

**4-Edit the /etc/pam.d/su file**

 

    vi  /etc/pam.d/su
    #add the line
    session required pam_limits.so

 
 

**5-Verify that the NTP Daemon is Running**

 

    chkconfig --list ntpd
    #if is not on use the commands
    chkconfig ntpd on
    #start ntp service
    /etc/init.d/ntpd start



**6-Remove Nonessential Applications**
 
 
    For optimal performance, Vertica is designed to use all available resources on each host machine. Vertica recommends that you remove or disable all non-essential applications from cluster hosts.

 

**7-Configuring the Network**
 

 

Alter the **/etc/hosts** file.
Make sure file exists and that it contains the loopback address 127.0.0.1

 

**7.1-Setting Up Cluster Hosts**
 

 

Make sure that the /etc/hosts file includes all of the hosts that become part of the cluster.
For example, if the hosts are named host01, host02, host03, and host04, the **/etc/hosts** file on each host looks like this:

 

    # Do not remove the following line, or various programs
    # that require network functionality will fail.
    127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost
    192.xxx.13.128          host01
    192.xxx.13.129          host02
    192.xxx.13.130          host03
    192.xxx.13.131          host04

 
This should be done in all hosts(nodes)

**7.2- Edit the /etc/sysconfig/network file :**

 

    vim /etc/ sysconfig/network
    Alter the hostname and set it to the desired name :
    HOSTNAME=host01

 
 

**7.3 Setting the HOSTNAME Environment Variable**

 

    vim /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc
    Add the line
    export HOSTNAME=hostname

 
**7.4-Verify that the hostname resolution works correctly**
Verify this with the command

    /bin/hostname
    Hostname



Restart the hosts(nodes)
Make sure you do all this steps in all Hosts(nodes)as root user.

**7.5 Disable the firewall**
 

Firewalls not recommended for database hosts
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)
Iptables

**7.6 Provide Root and for dbadmin user to SSH Access to the Cluster**
 

Steps to do it for root or dbadmin user:

 

    [root@Vertica_Master1 ~]# ssh-keygen
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
    /root/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
    Overwrite (y/n) y
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    7c:b5:11:48:d3:c1:e6:f5:80:b3:4a:4a:93:ed:16:99
     root@Vertica_Master1
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |         .o+oo   |
    |          ..*.o  |
    |         o =o+ o |
    |       .+ E.oo  .|
    |       .S=.o.    |
    |        ..+      |
    |         .       |
    |                 |
    |                 |
    +-----------------+
    [root@Vertica_Master1 ~]# cd ~
    [root@Vertica_Master1 ~]# chmod 700 .ssh
    [root@Vertica_Master1 ~]# cd .ssh/
    [root@Vertica_Master1 .ssh]# cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys

 
**Do on all hosts the steps show upper and then follow the next steps**

 

    [root@Vertica_Master1 .ssh]# cat id_rsa.pub
    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEArX26Pgsyvkw+o0Vimm26FSOAtTh9C9
    mZ+tS7LfO92y7RDKsSm38tSQO/p1f2NWP6UzAam8dG77Zo8W+wjwF6bEJbFU9Gq+S/j
    hETD8bMTKh6odZNhXmZanddvH4qnA0eKngAPe9Y93udA6kEYGpA0sCWMFcbrtvwraz7@Vertica_Master1
    [root@Vertica_Master1 .ssh]# ssh root@Vertica_Master2
    The authenticity of host 'vertica_master2 (10.xxx.1.224)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is ff:9c:48:27:7d:6b:a1:39:5a:17:d0:a3:a3:9d:f0:48.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no) yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'vertica_master2,10.xxx.1.224' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    root@vertica_master2's password:xxxxxx- this is the password for the root user
    Last login: Tue Sep  4 15:11:35 2012 from e05347
    -bash: Vertica_Master2: command not found
    [root@Vertica_Master2 ~]# hostname-check to see that you are on the Vertica_Master2
    Vertica_Master2
     
    [root@Vertica_Master1 .ssh]# vim authorized_keys

 And copy the the content of the id_rsa.pub into authorized_keys and save it .
 

   Do this for all hosts so that they all have the keys form all hosts in their authorized_keys file.

 - Host1 will hold host1,host2,host3 public keys inside
 - Host2 will hold host1,host2,host3 public keys inside
 - Host3 will hold host1,host2,host3 public keys inside

-and so on if you have more hosts in your cluster.

 

**8 -Download and install Vertica software on Master Node(where you will run the Administrative jobs of the cluster)**
 
As root :

 

    #rpm -ihv  vertica-<version>.x86_64.RHEL5.rpm
    After entering the command, a progress indicator appears:
    Preparing...   ##################################### [100%]
    1:vertica      ##################################### [100%]
    Vertica 6.0.xx successfully installed on host hostname.

 
Normally by default vertica will be installed into **/opt/vertica** dir.

 

**8.1- Run the Install Script**
 
On the master node run the following command(The master node would be the node you most access for admin work)

 

    /opt/vertica/sbin/install_vertica -s host_list -r rpm_package -u dba_username

 
**Where options are :**
**-s** host_list comma-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses to include in the cluster; do not include space characters in the list.
Example :

 

    -s host01,host02,host03

or

    -s 192.xxx.233.101,192.xxx.233.102,192.xxx.233.103

 
**-r** rpm_package The pathname of the Vertica RPM package.
 
**Example:**

  **-r** "vertica_6.0.x.x86_64.RHEL5.rpm"
  **-u** dba_username
   -this will be the name of the user how will run the admintools(only)
   - If you omit the  parameter, the default database administrator account name is dbadmin.
 
**Example of full command for 3 nodes cluster :**


 

    # /opt/vertica/sbin/install_vertica -s 10.xxx.1.216,10.xxx.1.224,10.xxx.1.225 -r
     /home/user/Downloads/vertica-6.0.0-3.x86_64.RHEL5.rpm -u dbadmin

 
 

**9 â€“ Create the Vertica Data and Catalog directories on each node:**


    Directory names are totally up to you. Remember that database user must have owner rights over them.
*Note: this refers to extra directories added after installation*

 

    mkdir /vertica_db/data
    mkdir /vertica_db/data
    chown  dbadmin:dbadmin  vertica_db/

 
 

**10- Add the /opt/vertica/bin to you dbadmin user path so you can access the vertica tools without the full path.**
 

 

 

**11- Access the adminTool and you will be asked to introduce the licence.dat file provided by Vertica.(this applies only for Enterprise Edition).**
 

 

 

**12- Create the database and chose on which nodes it will reside !!
Follow the next steps to see how to create a database that will reside on the Vertica Cluster .**
