## Math using dc
`dc` is one of the oldest language on Unix.

It is using the [reverse polish notation][1], which means that you are first stacking numbers, then operations. For example `1+1` is written as `1 1+`.

To print an element from the top of the stack use command `p`

    echo '2 3 + p' | dc
    5

    or

    dc <<< '2 3 + p'
    5

You can print the top element many times

    dc <<< '1 1 + p 2 + p'
    2
    4

For negative numbers use `_` prefix

    dc <<< '_1 p'
    -1

You can also use capital letters from `A to F` for numbers between `10 and 15` and `.` as a decimal point

    dc <<< 'A.4 p'
    10.4

`dc` is using [abitrary precision][2] which means that the precision is limited only by the available memory. By default the precision is set to 0 decimals

    dc <<< '4 3 / p'
    1

We can increase the precision using command `k`. `2k` will use 

    dc <<< '2k 4 3 / p'
    1.33

    dc <<< '4k 4 3 / p'
    1.3333

You can also use it over multiple lines
    
    dc << EOF
    1 1 +
    3 *
    p
    EOF
    6


> `bc` is a preprocessor for `dc`.

## Math using bc
[`bc`][1] is an arbitrary precision calculator language. It could be used interactively or be executed from command line.

For example, it can print out the result of an expression:

    echo '2 + 3' | bc
    5
    
    echo '12 / 5' | bc
    2

For floating-post arithmetic, you can import standard library `bc -l`:

    echo '12 / 5' | bc -l
    2.40000000000000000000

It can be used for comparing expressions:

    echo '8 > 5' | bc
    1

    echo '10 == 11' | bc
    0

    echo '10 == 10 && 8 > 3' | bc
    1

## Math using bash capabilities
Arithmetic computation can be also done without involving any other programs like this:

Multiplication:

    echo $((5 * 2))
    10

Division:
    
    echo $((5 / 2))
    2

Modulo:

    echo $((5 % 2))
    1

Exponentiation:

    echo $((5 ** 2))
    25



## Math using expr
`expr` or `Evaluate expressions` evaluates an expression and writes the result on standard output

Basic arithmetics

    expr 2 + 3
    5

When multiplying, you need to escape the `*` sign

    expr 2 \* 3
    6

You can also use variables

    a=2
    expr $a + 3
    5

Keep in mind that it only supports integers, so expression like this

    expr 3.0 / 2

**will throw an error** `expr: not a decimal number: '3.0'`.


It supports regular expression to match patterns

    expr 'Hello World' : 'Hell\(.*\)rld'
    o Wo

Or find the index of the first char in the search string
> This will throw `expr: syntax error` on **Mac OS X**, because it uses **BSD expr** which does not have the index command, while expr on Linux is generally **GNU expr**

    expr index hello l
    3

    expr index 'hello' 'lo'
    3
