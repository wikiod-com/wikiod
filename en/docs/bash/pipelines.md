## Syntax
 - [time [-p]] [!] command1 [ | or |& command2 ] â€¦

A pipeline is a sequence of simple commands separated by one of the control operators `|` or `|&` ([source][1]).

`|` connects the output of `command1` to the input of `command2`.

`|&` connects standard output and standard error of `command1` to the standard input of `command2`.

## Using |&
`|&` connects standard output and standard error of the first command to the second one while `|` only connects standard output of the first command to the second command.

In this example, the page is downloaded via `curl`. with `-v` option `curl` writes some info on `stderr` including , the downloaded page is written on `stdout`. Title of page can be found between `<title>` and `</title>`.

    curl -vs 'http://www.google.com/' |& awk '/Host:/{print} /<title>/{match($0,/<title>(.*)<\/title>/,a);print a[1]}'

Output is:

    > Host: www.google.com
    Google

But with `|` a lot more information will be printed, i.e. those that are sent to `stderr` because only `stdout` is piped to the next command. In this example all lines except the last line (Google) were sent to `stderr` by `curl`:

## Show all processes paginated
    ps -e | less

`ps -e` shows all the processes, its output is connected to the input of more via `|`, `less` paginates the results.


## Modify continuous output of a command
    ~$ ping -c 1 google.com # unmodified output

The pipe (`|`) connects the `stdout` of `ping` to the `stdin` of `grep`, which processes it immediately. Some other commands like `sed` default to buffering their `stdin`, which means that it has to receive enough data, before it will print anything, potentially causing delays in further processing.
