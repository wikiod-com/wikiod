## Syntax
- getopts optstring name [args]


## Parameters
| Parameter | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| optstring | The option characters to be recognized |
| name      | Then name where parsed option is stored|

# Options

> `optstring` : The option characters to be recognized
>
>> If a character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to 
>> have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space. 
>> The colon (`:`) and question mark (`?`) can not be used as option characters.

Each time it is invoked, `getopts` places the next option in the shell variable name, initializing name if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable `OPTIND`. `OPTIND` is initialized to `1` each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.

When an option requires an argument, `getopts` places that argument into the variable `OPTARG`. The shell does not reset `OPTIND` automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls to `getopts` within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.

When the end of options is encountered, `getopts` exits with a return value greater than zero.

`OPTIND` is set to the index of the first non-option argument, and name is set to `?`. `getopts` normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are given in `args`, `getopts` parses those instead.

`getopts` can report errors in two ways. If the first character of `optstring` is a colon (`:`), silent error reporting is used. In normal operation diagnostic messages are printed when invalid options or missing option arguments are encountered. 

If the variable `OPTERR` is set to `0`, no error messages will be displayed, even if the first character of `optstring` is not a colon.

If an invalid option is seen, `getopts` places `?` into `name` and, if not silent, prints an error message and unsets `OPTARG`. If `getopts` is silent, the option character found is placed in `OPTARG` and no diagnostic message is printed.

If a required argument is not found, and `getopts` is not silent, a question mark (`?`) is placed in `name`, `OPTARG` is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed. If `getopts` is silent, then a colon (`:`) is placed in name and `OPTARG` is set to the option character.


## pingnmap

    # Script name : pingnmap
    # Scenario : The systems admin in company X is tired of the monotonous job
    # of pinging and nmapping, so he decided to simplify the job using a script.
    # The tasks he wish to achieve is
    # 1. Ping - with a max count of 5 -the given IP address/domain. AND/OR
    # 2. Check if a particular port is open with a given IP address/domain.
    # And getopts is for her rescue.
    # A brief overview of the options
    # n : meant for nmap
    # t : meant for ping
    # i : The option to enter the IP address
    # p : The option to enter the port
    # v : The option to get the script version
    
    
    while getopts ':nti:p:v' opt
    #putting : in the beginnnig suppresses the errors for invalid options
