| `-1`   | List one file per line  |

## List Files in a Long Listing Format
The `ls` command's `-l` option prints a specified directory's contents in a long listing format. If no directory is specified then, by default, the contents of the current directory are listed.

    ls -l /etc

Example Output:

    total 1204
    drwxr-xr-x  3 root root    4096 Apr 21 03:44 acpi
    -rw-r--r--  1 root root    3028 Apr 21 03:38 adduser.conf
    drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    4096 Jun 11 20:42 alternatives
    ...

The output first displays `total`, which indicates the total size in **blocks** of all the files in the listed directory. It then displays eight columns of information for each file in the listed directory. Below are the details for each column in the output:

| Column No. | Example    | Description
| ------     | ------     | -----------
| 1.1        | `d`          |File type (see table below)
| 1.2        |`rwxr-xr-x`   |Permission string
| 2          |`3`           |Number of hard links
| 3          |`root`        |Owner name
| 4          |`root`        |Owner group
| 5          |`4096`        |File size in bytes
| 6          |`Apr 21 03:44`|Modification time
| 7          |`acpi`        |File name

# File Type

The file type can be one of any of the following characters.

|Character|File Type 
|---------|---------
|`-`|Regular file
|`b`|Block special file
|`c`|Character special file
|`C`|High performance ("contiguous data") file
|`d`|Directory
|`D`|Door (special IPC file in Solaris 2.5+ only)
|`l`|Symbolic link
|`M`|Off-line ("migrated") file (Cray DMF)
|`n`|Network special file (HP-UX)
|`p`|FIFO (named pipe)
|`P`|Port (special system file in Solaris 10+ only)
|`s`|Socket
|`?`|Some other file type



## List the Ten Most Recently Modified Files
The following will list up to ten of the most recently modified files in the current directory, using a long listing format (`-l`) and sorted by time (`-t`).

    ls -lt | head



## List All Files Including Dotfiles
A **dotfile** is a file whose names begin with a `.`. These are normally hidden by `ls` and not listed unless requested. 

For example the following output of `ls`:

    $ ls
    bin  pki


The `-a` or `--all` option will list all files, including dotfiles.

    $ ls -a
    .   .ansible       .bash_logout   .bashrc  .lesshst  .puppetlabs  .viminfo
    ..  .bash_history  .bash_profile  bin      pki       .ssh
  
The `-A` or `--almost-all` option will list all files, including dotfiles, but does not list implied `.` and `..`. Note that `.` is the current directory and `..` is the parent directory.
    
    $ ls -A 
    .ansible       .bash_logout   .bashrc  .lesshst  .puppetlabs  .viminfo
    .bash_history  .bash_profile  bin      pki       .ssh


## List Files
The `ls` command lists the contents of a specified directory, **excluding** dotfiles. If no directory is specified then, by default, the contents of the current directory are listed.

Listed files are sorted alphabetically, by default, and aligned in columns if they don’t fit on one line.

<!-- language: none -->

    $ ls
    apt  configs  Documents  Fonts    Music      Programming  Templates  workspace
    bin  Desktop  eclipse    git      Pictures   Public       Videos

## List Files Without Using `ls`
Use the Bash shell's [filename expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Filename-Expansion) and [brace expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Brace-Expansion) capabilities to obtain the filenames:

    # display the files and directories that are in the current directory
    printf "%s\n" *
    
    # display only the directories in the current directory
    printf "%s\n" */
    
    # display only (some) image files
    printf "%s\n" *.{gif,jpg,png}

To capture a list of files into a variable for processing, it is typically good practice to use a [bash array](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Arrays):

    files=( * )
    
    # iterate over them
    for file in "${files[@]}"; do
        echo "$file"
    done



## List Files in a Tree-Like Format
The `tree` command lists the contents of a specified directory in a tree-like format. If no directory is specified then, by default, the contents of the current directory are listed.

Example Output:

    $ tree /tmp
    /tmp
    ├── 5037
    ├── adb.log
    └── evince-20965
        └── image.FPWTJY.png

Use the `tree` command's `-L` option to limit the display depth and the `-d` option to only list directories.

Example Output:

    $ tree -L 1 -d /tmp
    /tmp
    └── evince-20965




## List Files Sorted by Size
The `ls` command's `-S` option sorts the files in descending order of file size.

    $ ls -l -S ./Fruits
    total 444
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 295303 Jul 28 19:19 apples.jpg
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 102283 Jul 28 19:19 kiwis.jpg
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root  50197 Jul 28 19:19 bananas.jpg

When used with the `-r` option the sort order is reversed.

    $ ls -l -S -r /Fruits
    total 444
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root  50197 Jul 28 19:19 bananas.jpg
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 102283 Jul 28 19:19 kiwis.jpg
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 295303 Jul 28 19:19 apples.jpg
