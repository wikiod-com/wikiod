## Dynamic scoping in action
Dynamic scoping means that variable lookups occur in the scope where a function is *called*, not where it is *defined*.

    $ x=3
    $ func1 () { echo "in func1: $x"; }
    $ func2 () { local x=9; func1; }
    $ func2
    in func1: 9
    $ func1
    in func1: 3
    
In a lexically scoped language, `func1` would *always* look in the global scope for the value of `x`, because `func1` is *defined* in the local scope.

In a dynamically scoped language, `func1` looks in the scope where it is *called*. When it is called from within `func2`, it first looks in the body of `func2` for a value of `x`. If it weren't defined there, it would look in the global scope, where `func2` was called from.
