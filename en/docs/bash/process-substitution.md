Process substitution is a form of redirection where the input or output of a process (some sequence of commands) appear as a temporary file.

## Compare two files from the web
The following compares two files with `diff` using process substitution instead of creating temporary files.

    diff <(curl http://www.example.com/page1) <(curl http://www.example.com/page2)



## Feed a while loop with the output of a command
This feeds a `while` loop with the output of a `grep` command:

    while IFS=":" read -r user _
    do
        # "$user" holds the username in /etc/passwd
    done < <(grep "hello" /etc/passwd)



## Concatenating files
It is well known that you cannot use the same file for input and ouput in the same command. For instance,

    $ cat header.txt body.txt >body.txt

doesn’t do what you want. By the time `cat` reads `body.txt`, it has already been truncated by the redirection and it is empty. The final result will be that `body.txt` will hold the contents of `header.txt` _only._

One might think to avoid this with process substitution, that is, that the command

    $ cat header.txt <(cat body.txt) > body.txt

will force the original contents of `body.txt` to be somehow saved in some buffer somewhere before the file is truncated by the redirection. It doesn’t work. The `cat` in parentheses begins reading the file only after all file descriptors have been set up, just like the outer one. There is no point in trying to use process substitution in this case.

The only way to prepend a file to another file is to create an intermediate one:

    $ cat header.txt body.txt >body.txt.new
    $ mv body.txt.new body.txt

which is what `sed` or `perl` or similar programs do under the carpet when called with an _edit-in-place_ option (usually `-i`). 

## With paste command
    # Process substitution with paste command is common
    # To compare the contents of two directories
    paste <( ls /path/to/directory1 ) <( ls /path/to/directory1 )
    

## Stream a file through multiple programs at once
This counts the number of lines in a big file with `wc -l` while simultaneously compressing it with `gzip`.  Both run concurrently.

    tee >(wc -l >&2) < bigfile | gzip > bigfile.gz

Normally `tee` writes its input to one or more files (and stdout).  We can write to commands instead of files with `tee >(command)`.  

Here the command `wc -l >&2` counts the lines read from `tee` (which in turn is reading from `bigfile`).  (The line count is sent to stderr (`>&2`) to avoid mixing with the input to `gzip`.)  The stdout of `tee` is simultaneously fed into `gzip`.

## To avoid usage of a sub-shell
One major aspect of process substitution is that it lets us avoid usage of a sub-shell when piping commands from the shell.

This can be demonstrated with a simple example below. I have the following files in my current folder:

    $ find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -print
    foo bar zoo foobar foozoo barzoo 

If I pipe to a `while`/`read` loop that increments a counter as follows:

    count=0
    find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -print | while IFS= read -r _; do
        ((count++))
    done

`$count` now does *not* contain `6`, because it was modified in the sub-shell context. Any of the commands shown below are run in a sub-shell context and the scope of the variables used within are lost after the sub-shell terminates.

    command &
    command | command 
    ( command )

Process substitution will solve the problem by avoiding use the of pipe `|` operator as in

    count=0
    while IFS= read -r _; do
        ((count++))
    done < <(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -print)

This will retain the `count` variable value as no sub-shells are invoked.
