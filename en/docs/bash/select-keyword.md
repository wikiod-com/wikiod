## Select keyword can be used for getting input argument in a menu format
Suppose you want the `user` to `select` keywords from a menu, we can create a script similar to 

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    
    select os in "linux" "windows" "mac"
    do
        echo "${os}"
        break
    done

Explanation:
Here `select` keyword is used to loop through a list of items that will be presented at the command prompt for a user to pick from. Notice the `break` keyword for breaking out of the loop once the user makes a choice. Otherwise, the loop will be endless!

Results:
Upon running this script, a menu of these items will be displayed and the user will be prompted for a selection. Upon selection, the value will be displayed, returning back to command prompt.

    >bash select_menu.sh
    1) linux
    2) windows
    3) mac
    #? 3
    mac
    >
