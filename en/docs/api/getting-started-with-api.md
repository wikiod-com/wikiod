## What is an API?
**API**: Application programming interface are the set of requirements which govern how one application can talk to another, API's are what makes the information exchange between programs possible.

 - For Example System-level APIs makes it possible for applications like
   LibreOffice to run on top of an OS like Windows in the first place.
   On web API are responible to let other apps to piggyback to the large
   service proivder such as Google maps or Facebook
   offering(Services).Like nearby hotels shown on a particular app via
   using google maps API's by an app. 
-  APIs do all this by “exposing”
   some of a program’s internal functions to the outside world in a
   limited fashion. That makes it possible for applications to share
   data and take actions on one another’s behalf without requiring
   developers to share all of their software’s code.
