MPI is a standard, not a programming library. There are many implementations of the standard. The most common open source ones are [MPICH](www.mpich.org) and [Open MPI](www.open-mpi.org). There are many derivatives of these two libraries that are either open source or commercial (or both).

It's important to know which implementation you have because the way you compile or run your program might change subtly. 

## Installing MPICH on Mac with Homebrew
    brew install mpich

## Installing Open MPI on Mac with Homebrew
    brew install open-mpi
