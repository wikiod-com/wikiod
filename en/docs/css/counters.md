## Syntax
 - counter-set: [ &lt;counter-name> &lt;integer>? ]+ | none

 - counter-reset: [ &lt;counter-name> &lt;integer>? ]+ | none

 - counter-increment: [ &lt;counter-name> &lt;integer>? ]+ | none

 - counter(&lt;counter-name> [, &lt;counter-style> ]?)

 - counters(&lt;counter-name>, &lt;connector-string> [, &lt;counter-style> ]?)

## Parameters
| Parameter      | Details |
| ------         | ------ |
| counter-name   | This is the name of the counter that needs to be created or incremented or printed. It can be any custom name as the developer wishes.   |
| integer        | This integer is an optional value that when provided next to the counter name will represent the initial value of the counter (in `counter-set`, `counter-reset` properties) or the value by which the counter should be incremented (in `counter-increment`).  |
| none           | This is the initial value for all 3 `counter-*` properties. When this value is used for `counter-increment`, the value of none of the counters are affected. When this is used for the other two, no counter is created. |
| counter-style  | This specifies the style in which the counter value needs to be displayed. It supports all values supported by the `list-style-type` property. If `none` is used then the counter value is not printed at all. |
| connector-string  | This represents the string that must be placed between the values of two different counter levels (like the "." in "2.1.1").

Counters are not a new topic in CSS. It was a part of the CSS Level 2 Specifications (Revision 1 to be precise) itself and hence has very high browser support.

All browsers except IE6 and IE7 have support for CSS Counters.

## Applying roman numerals styling to the counter output
CSS
====

    body {
      counter-reset: item-counter;
    }
    
    .item {
      counter-increment: item-counter;
    }
    
    .item:before {
      content: counter(item-counter, upper-roman) ". "; /* by specifying the upper-roman as style the output would be in roman numbers */
    }


HTML
====

    <div class='item'>Item No: 1</div>
    <div class='item'>Item No: 2</div>
    <div class='item'>Item No: 3</div>

In the above example, the counter's output would be displayed as I, II, III (roman numbers) instead of the usual 1, 2, 3 as the developer has explicitly specified the counter's style.

## Number each item using CSS Counter
CSS
======

    body {
      counter-reset: item-counter; /* create the counter */
    }
    .item {
      counter-increment: item-counter; /* increment the counter every time an element with class "item" is encountered */
    }
    .item-header:before {
      content: counter(item-counter) ". "; /* print the value of the counter before the header and append a "." to it */
    }
    
    /* just for demo */
    
    .item {
      border: 1px solid;
      height: 100px;
      margin-bottom: 10px;
    }
    .item-header {
      border-bottom: 1px solid;
      height: 40px;
      line-height: 40px;
      padding: 5px;
    }
    .item-content {
      padding: 8px;
    }

HTML
======

    <div class='item'>
      <div class='item-header'>Item 1 Header</div>
      <div class='item-content'>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet....</div>
    </div>
    <div class='item'>
      <div class='item-header'>Item 2 Header</div>
      <div class='item-content'>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet....</div>
    </div>
    <div class='item'>
      <div class='item-header'>Item 3 Header</div>
      <div class='item-content'>Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit Amet....</div>
    </div>

The above example numbers every "item" in the page and adds the item's number before its header (using `content` property of `.item-header` element's `:before` pseudo). A live demo of this code is available [here](https://jsfiddle.net/a7rmje3r/).

## Implementing multi-level numbering using CSS counters
CSS
=======

    ul {
      list-style: none;
      counter-reset: list-item-number; /* self nesting counter as name is same for all levels */
    }
    li {
      counter-increment: list-item-number;
    }
    li:before {
      content: counters(list-item-number, ".") " "; /* usage of counters() function means value of counters at all higher levels are combined before printing */
    }

HTML
=======

    <ul>
      <li>Level 1
        <ul>
          <li>Level 1.1
            <ul>
              <li>Level 1.1.1</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Level 2
        <ul>
          <li>Level 2.1
            <ul>
              <li>Level 2.1.1</li>
              <li>Level 2.1.2</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Level 3</li>
    </ul>

The above is an example of multi-level numbering using CSS counters. It makes use of the ***self-nesting*** concept of counters. Self nesting is a concept where if an element already has a counter with the given name but is having to create another then it creates it as a child of the existing counter. Here, the second level `ul` already inherits the `list-item-number` counter from its parent but then has to create its own `list-item-number` (for its children `li`) and so creates `list-item-number[1]` (counter for second level) and nests it under `list-item-number[0]` (counter for first level). Thus it achieves the multi-level numbering.

The output is printed using the `counters()` function instead of the `counter()` function because the `counters()` function is designed to prefix the value of all higher level counters (parent) when printing the output.
