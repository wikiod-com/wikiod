## Syntax
 - overflow: visible | hidden | scroll | auto | initial | inherit;

## Parameters
| `Overflow` Value | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| `visible`   | Shows all overflowing content outside the element   |
| `scroll`   | Hides the overflowing content and adds a scroll bar   |
| `hidden`   | Hides the overflowing content, both scroll bars disappear and the page becomes fixed   |
| `auto`   | Same as `scroll` if content overflows, but doesn't add scroll bar if content fits  |
| `inherit`   | Inherit's the parent element's value for this property   |



> [The `overflow` property specifies whether to clip content, render
> scrollbars, or stretch a container to display content when it
> overflows its block level container.][1]

When an element is too small to display it's contents, what happens? By default, the content will just overflow and display outside the element. That makes your work look bad. You want your work to look good, so you set the overflow property to handle the overflowing content in a desirable way.

Values for the `overflow` property are identical to those for the `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` properties, exept that they apply along each axis

The `overflow-wrap` property has also been known as the `word-wrap` property.


> Important note: [Using the overflow property with a value different to
> visible will create a new block formatting context.][1]

## overflow-wrap
`overflow-wrap` tells a browser that it can break a line of text inside a targeted element onto multiple lines in an otherwise unbreakable place. Helpful in preventing an long string of text causing layout problems due to overflowing it's container.

**CSS**

    div {
        width:100px;
        outline: 1px dashed #bbb;
    }

    #div1 {
        overflow-wrap:normal;
    }

    #div2 {
        overflow-wrap:break-word;
    }

**HTML**
    
    <div id="div1">
          <strong>#div1</strong>: Small words are displayed normally, but a long word like <span style="red;">supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</span> is too long so it will overflow past the edge of the line-break
    </div>

    <div id="div2">
          <strong>#div2</strong>: Small words are displayed normally, but a long word like <span style="red;">supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</span> will be split at the line break and continue on the next line.
    </div>

## overflow: scroll
**HTML**    

```
<div>
    This div is too small to display its contents to display the effects of the overflow property.
</div>
```

**CSS**
```
div {
    width:100px;
    height:100px;
    overflow:scroll;
}
```

**Result**

[![Image showing a 100px by 100px div with scroll bars][1]][1]

The content above is clipped in a 100px by 100px box, with scrolling available to view overflowing content. 

Most desktop browsers will display both horizontal and vertical scrollbars, whether or not any content is clipped. This can avoid problems with scrollbars appearing and disappearing in a dynamic environment. Printers may print overflowing content.

## overflow: visible
**HTML**    

```
<div>
     Even if this div is too small to display its contents, the content is not clipped.
</div>
```

**CSS**
```
div {
     width:50px;
     height:50px;
     overflow:visible;
}
```

**Result**

Content is not clipped and will be rendered outside the content box if it exceeds its container size.

## Block Formatting Context Created with Overflow
Using the `overflow` property with a value different to `visible` will create a new **block formatting context**. This is useful for aligning a block element next to a floated element.

**CSS**

    img {
        float:left;
        margin-right: 10px;
    }
     div {
         overflow:hidden; /* creates block formatting context */
    }

**HTML**
    
    <img src="http://placehold.it/100x100">
    <div>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, cum no paulo mollis pertinacia.</p>
      <p>Ad case omnis nam, mutat deseruisse persequeris eos ad, in tollit debitis sea.</p>
    </div>

This example shows how paragraphs within a div with the `overflow` property set will interact with a floated image.

## overflow-x and overflow-y
These two properties work in a similar fashion as the `overflow` property and accept the same values. The `overflow-x` parameter works only on the x or left-to-right axis. The `overflow-y` works on the y or top-to-bottom axis.

**HTML**

    <div id="div-x">
        If this div is too small to display its contents, 
        the content to the left and right will be clipped.
    </div>

    <div id="div-y">
        If this div is too small to display its contents, 
        the content to the top and bottom will be clipped.
    </div>

**CSS**

<!-- language: lang-css -->

    div {
        width: 200px;
        height: 200px;
    }
    
    #div-x {
        overflow-x: hidden;
    }
    
    #div-y {
        overflow-y: hidden;
    }
