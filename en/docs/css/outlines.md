`outline` is now described in [Basic UI](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-ui-3/#outline-props), a CSS Module Level 3 (it was already described in REC CSS2.1)

-----
Outline property is defined by default in browsers for focusable elements in **`:focus`** state.  
It shouldn't be removed, see http://outlinenone.com which states:

> **What does the outline property do?**
> 
> It provides visual feedback for links that have "focus" when navigating a web document using the TAB key (or equivalent). This is especially useful for folks who can't use a mouse or have a visual impairment. If you remove the outline you are making your site inaccessible for these people. (â€¦)

## Overview
Outline is a line that goes around the element, outside of the border. In contrast to ``border``, outlines do not take any space in the box model. So adding an outline to an element does not affect the position of the element or other elements.

In addition, outlines can be non-rectangular in some browsers. This can happen if ``outline`` is applied on a ``span`` element that has text with different ``font-size`` properties inside it. Unlike borders, outlines *cannot* have rounded corners.

The essential parts of ``outline`` are ``outline-color``, ``outline-style`` and ``outline-width``.

The definition of an outline is equivalent to the definition of a border:

> An outline is a line around an element. It is displayed around the margin of the element. However, it is different from the border property.

```
outline: 1px solid black;
```

## outline-style
The `outline-style` property is used to set the style of the outline of an element.

<!-- language: lang-css -->

    p {
      border: 1px solid black;
      outline-color:blue;
      line-height:30px;
    }
    .p1{
      outline-style: dotted;
    }
    .p2{
      outline-style: dashed;
    }
    .p3{
      outline-style: solid;
    }
    .p4{
      outline-style: double;
    }
    .p5{
      outline-style: groove;
    }
    .p6{
      outline-style: ridge;
    }
    .p7{
      outline-style: inset;
    }
    .p8{
      outline-style: outset;
    }
