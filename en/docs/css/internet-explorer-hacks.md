These “hacks” may be used to target a specific browser/client. This may be used to work around browser rendering differences by applying styles in one of those wrappers listed above.

## Adding Inline Block support to IE6 and IE7
    display: inline-block;

The `display` property with the value of `inline-block` is not supported by Internet Explorer 6 and 7. A work-around for this is:

    zoom: 1;
    *display: inline;

The `zoom` property triggers the `hasLayout` feature of elements, and it is available only in Internet Explorer. The `*display` makes sure that the invalid property executes only on the affected browsers. Other browsers will simply ignore the rule.

## High Contrast Mode in Internet Explorer 10 and greater
<!-- language-all: lang-css -->

In Internet Explorer 10+ and Edge, Microsoft provides the `-ms-high-contrast` media selector to expose the "High Contrast" setting from the browser, which allows the programmer to adjust their site's styles accordingly.

The `-ms-high-contrast` selector has 3 states: `active`, `black-on-white`, and `white-on-black`. In IE10+ it also had a `none` state, but that is no longer supported in Edge going forward.

## Examples

    @media screen and (-ms-high-contrast: active), (-ms-high-contrast: black-on-white) {
       .header{
          background: #fff;
          color: #000;
       }
    }

This will change the header background to white and the text color to black when high contrast mode is active *and* it is in `black-on-white` mode. 

    @media screen and (-ms-high-contrast: white-on-black) {
       .header{
          background: #000;
          color: #fff;
       }
    }

Similar to the first example, but this specifically selects the `white-on-black` state only, and inverts the header colors to a black background with white text.

[Microsoft Documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465764.aspx) on `-ms-high-contrast`

## Internet Explorer 6 & Internet Explorer 7 only
To target Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7, start your properties with `*`:

    .hide-on-ie6-and-ie7 {
        *display : none; // This line is processed only on IE6 and IE7
    }

Non-alphanumeric prefixes (other than hyphens and underscores) are ignored in IE6 and IE7, so this hack works for any unprefixed `property: value` pair.

## Internet Explorer 8 only
To target Internet Explorer 8, wrap your selectors inside `@media \0 screen { }`:

    @media \0 screen {
        .hide-on-ie8 {
            display : none;
        }
    }

Everything between `@media \0 screen { }` is processed only by I
