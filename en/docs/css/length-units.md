A CSS distance measurement is a number immediately followed by a length unit (px, em, pc, in, â€¦)

CSS supports a number of length measurements units. They are absolute or relative.

## Syntax
 - *value***unit**
 - 1em

## Parameters
| Unit | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| %    | Define sizes in terms of parent objects or current object dependent on property  | 
| em | Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font) | 
| rem  |  Relative to font-size of the root element | 
|vw    |Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*| 
|vh   | Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*| 
|vmin  |  Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension| 
|vmax   | Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension| 
| cm   | centimeters | 
| mm   | millimeters | 
| in   | inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm) | 
| px   | pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in) | 
| pt   | points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in) | 
| pc   | picas (1pc = 12 pt) | 
| s    | seconds (used for animations and transitions) | 
| ms   | milliseconds (used for animations and transitions) | 
| ex   | Relative to the x-height of the current font | 
| ch   | Based on the width of the zero (0) character | 
| fr   | fractional unit (used for CSS Grid Layout) | 

- A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.

- For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.

## Creating scalable elements using rems and ems
<!-- if version [gte 3] -->
You can use `rem` defined by the `font-size` of your `html` tag to style elements by setting their `font-size` to a value of `rem` and use `em` inside the element to create  elements that scale with your global `font-size`.

**HTML:**

    <input type="button" value="Button">
    <input type="range">
    <input type="text" value="Text">

**Relevant CSS:**

<!-- language: lang-css -->

    html {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    
    input[type="button"] {
      font-size: 1rem;
      padding: 0.5em 2em;
    }

    input[type="range"] {
      font-size: 1rem;
      width: 10em;
    }

    input[type=text] {
      font-size: 1rem;
      padding: 0.5em;
    }

## Font size with rem
CSS3 introduces a few new units, including the [`rem`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values/#font-relative-lengths) unit, which stands for "root em". Let's look at how `rem` works.

First, let's look at the differences between `em` and `rem`.

* **em**: Relative to the font size of the parent. This causes the compounding issue
* **rem**: Relative to the font size of the root or `<html>` element. This means it's possible to declare a single font size for the html element and define all `rem` units to be a percentage of that.

The main issue with using `rem` for font sizing is that the values are somewhat difficult to use. Here is an example of some common font sizes expressed in `rem` units, assuming that the base size is 16px :

 - 10px = 0.625rem
 - 12px = 0.75rem
 - 14px = 0.875rem
 - 16px = 1rem (base)
 - 18px = 1.125rem
 - 20px = 1.25rem
 - 24px = 1.5rem
 - 30px = 1.875rem
 - 32px = 2rem

**CODE:**

<!-- if version [gte 3] -->

<!-- language: lang-css -->

    html { 
      font-size: 16px; 
    }
    
    h1 { 
      font-size: 2rem;          /* 32px */
    }
    
    p { 
      font-size: 1rem;          /* 16px */ 
    }
    
    li { 
      font-size: 1.5em;         /* 24px */
    }

<!-- end version if -->

## vmin and vmax
* **vmin**: Relative to 1 percent of the viewport's smaller dimension
* **vmax**: Relative to 1 percent of the viewport's larger dimension

In other words, 1 `vmin` is equal to the smaller of _1 vh_ and _1 vw_

1 `vmax` is equal to the larger of _1 vh_ and _1 vw_

**Note**: `vmax` is [not supported](http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units) in:
 - any version of Internet Explorer
 - Safari before version 6.1

## vh and vw
CSS3 introduced two units for representing size. 

* `vh`, which stands for `viewport height` is relative to 1% of the viewport height
* `vw`, which stands for `viewport width` is relative to 1% of the viewport width


<!-- if version [gte 3] -->
<!-- language: lang-css -->
    div { 
      width: 20vw; 
      height: 20vh;
    }
<!-- end version if -->

Above, the size for the div takes up 20% of the width and height of the viewport

## using percent %
One of the useful unit when creating a responsive application.

Its size depends on its parent container.

**Equation:** 

> ( Parent Container`s width ) * ( Percentage(%) ) = Output


**For Example:** 

*Parent* has **100px** width while the *Child* has **50%**. 

**On the output**, the *Child*'s width  will be half(50%) of the *Parent*'s,  which is **50px**.

**HTML**

    <div class="parent">
       PARENT
       <div class="child">
         CHILD
       </div>
    </div>

**CSS**

    <style>

    *{
      color: #CCC;
    }
    
    .parent{
      background-color: blue;
      width: 100px;
    }
    
    .child{
      background-color: green;
      width: 50%;
    }
    
    </style>

**OUTPUT**
