## Using the overflow property with a value different to visible
<!-- language: lang-css -->

    img{
      float:left;
      width:100px;
      margin:0 10px;
    }
    .div1{
      background:#f1f1f1;
      /* does not create block formatting context */
    }
    .div2{
      background:#f1f1f1;
      overflow:hidden;
      /* creates block formatting context */
    }
