Styles can be authored in several ways, allowing for varying degrees of reuse and scope when they are specified in a source HTML document. _External_ stylesheets can be reused across HTML documents. _Embedded_ stylesheets apply to the entire document in which they are specified. _Inline_ styles apply only to the individual HTML element on which they are specified.
