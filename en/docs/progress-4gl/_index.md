*ABL (Advanced Business Language). Earlier known as Progress 4GL.*

Progress ABL is a programming language tied to the Progress OpenEdge environment, its database and surrounding utilities. This makes it a "[fourth generation][1]" programming language. 

Progress ABL is a strongly typed, late-bound, English-like programming language with growing support for object orientation. The compiled code is run by the "AVM" (ABL Virtual Machine).

The language is developed and maintained by the [Progress Corporation][2] (formerly Progress Software).
