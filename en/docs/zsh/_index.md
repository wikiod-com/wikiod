`zsh` is a POSIX-compatible shell, and a popular alternative to the Bourne shell (`sh`) and `bash`.

Its key feature is a focus on a high level of customization by the user, which has led to an active community of developers creating extensions for `zsh`, including custom, more informative prompt status lines, often integrating with system services.

Many configurations with large sets of sensible defaults and useful extensions exist online, including the popular [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) and [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).
