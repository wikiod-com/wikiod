When building applications using Angular 2.x there are times when it's required to use any third party libraries like jQuery, Google Analytics, Chat Integration JavaScript APIs and etc.


## Configuration using angular-cli
## NPM

If external library like `jQuery` is installed using NPM

`npm install --save jquery`

Add script path into your `angular-cli.json`

```
"scripts": [
    "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js"
]
```

## Assets Folder

You can also save the library file in your `assets/js` directory and include the same in `angular-cli.json`

```
"scripts": [
    "assets/js/jquery.js"
]
```

## Note

Save your main library `jquery` and their dependencies like `jquery-cycle-plugin` into the assets directory and add both of them into `angular-cli.json`, make sure the order is maintained for the dependencies.

## Using jQuery in Angular 2.x components
To use `jquery` in your Angular 2.x components, declare a global variable on the top

If using `$` for jQuery

`declare var $: any;`

If using `jQuery` for jQuery

`declare var jQuery: any`

This will allow using `$` or `jQuery` into your Angular 2.x component.
