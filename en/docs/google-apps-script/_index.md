The official overview for Google Apps Script is published at http://www.google.com/script/start, from there

> Google Apps Script is a JavaScript cloud scripting language that provides easy ways to automate tasks across Google products and third party services and build web applications.

From https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/#basic_javascript_features

> Apps Script is based on [JavaScript 1.6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.6), plus a few features from [1.7](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.7) and [1.8](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.8). Many basic JavaScript features are thus available in addition to the built-in and [advanced Google services](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/advanced): you can use common objects like [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp), [and so forth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference), as well as the [Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) and [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) global objects. However, because Apps Script code runs on Google's servers (not client-side, except for [HTML-service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/) pages), browser-based features like DOM manipulation or the [Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) API are not available.
