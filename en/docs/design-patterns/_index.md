This section provides an overview of what design-patterns is, and why a developer might want to use it. Examples may provide a graphical representation of the pattern, a scenario consisting of a problem given a context in which a pattern can be used and mention possible trade offs.

It should also mention any large subjects within design-patterns, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for design-patterns is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
