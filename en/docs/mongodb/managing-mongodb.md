## Listing currently running queries
The following command lists out the queries that are currently being run on the server

    db.currentOp()
The output looks something similar to this

    {
        "inprog" : [
            {
                "opid" : "302616759",
                "active" : true,
                "secs_running" : 1,
                "microsecs_running" : NumberLong(1167662),
                "op" : "getmore",
                "ns" : "local.oplog.rs",
                "query" : {
                    
                },
                ...
            },
            {
                "desc" : "conn48",
                "threadId" : "0x114c00700",
                "connectionId" : 48,
                "opid" : "mdss_shard00:302616760",
                "active" : true,
                "secs_running" : 1,
                "microsecs_running" : NumberLong(1169659),
                "op" : "getmore",
                "ns" : "local.oplog.rs"
                ...
            }
        ]
    }
The `inprog` attribute indicates the queries are currently in progress. The `opid` is Id of the query or operation. `secs_running` indicates the time for which it has been running. This is sometimes useful to identify long running queries.
