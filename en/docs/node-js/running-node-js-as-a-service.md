Unlike many web servers, Node isn't installed as a service out of the box. But in production, it's better to have it run as a dæmon, managed by an init system.

## Node.js as a systemd dæmon
systemd is the _de facto_ init system in most Linux distributions. After Node has been configured to run with systemd, it's possible to use the `service` command to manage it.

First of all, it needs a config file, let's create it. For Debian based distros, it will be in `/etc/systemd/system/node.service`

    [Unit]
    Description=My super nodejs app

    [Service]
    # set the working directory to have consistent relative paths
    WorkingDirectory=/var/www/app

    # start the server file (file is relative to WorkingDirectory here)
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/node serverCluster.js

    # if process crashes, always try to restart
    Restart=always

    # let 500ms between the crash and the restart
    RestartSec=500ms

    # send log tot syslog here (it doesn't compete with other log config in the app itself)
    StandardOutput=syslog
    StandardError=syslog

    # nodejs process name in syslog
    SyslogIdentifier=nodejs

    # user and group starting the app
    User=www-data
    Group=www-data

    # set the environement (dev, prod…)
    Environment=NODE_ENV=production


    [Install]
    # start node at multi user system level (= sysVinit runlevel 3) 
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

It's now possible to respectively start, stop and restart the app with:

    service node start
    service node stop
    service node restart

To tell systemd to automatically start node on boot, just type: `systemctl enable node`.

That's all, node now runs as a dæmon.
