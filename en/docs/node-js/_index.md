Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O framework that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine. It is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching. It is open-source and cross-platform. Node.js applications are written in pure JavaScript and can be run within Node.js environment on Windows, Linux etcâ€¦
