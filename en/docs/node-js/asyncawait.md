Async/await is a set of keywords that allows writing of asynchronous code in a procedural manner without having to rely on callbacks (*callback hell*) or promise-chaining (`.then().then().then()`).

This works by using the `await` keyword to suspend the state of an async function, until the resolution of a promise, and using the `async` keyword to declare such async functions, which return a promise.

Async/await is available from node.js 8 by default or 7 using the flag `--harmony-async-await`.

## Async Functions with Try-Catch Error Handling
One of the best features of async/await syntax is that standard try-catch coding style is possible, just like you were writing synchronous code.

    const myFunc = async (req, res) => {
      try {
        const result = await somePromise();
      } catch (err) {
        // handle errors here
      }
    });

Here's an example with Express and promise-mysql:

    router.get('/flags/:id', async (req, res) => {

      try {

        const connection = await pool.createConnection();

        try {
          const sql = `SELECT f.id, f.width, f.height, f.code, f.filename
                       FROM flags f
                       WHERE f.id = ?
                       LIMIT 1`;
          const flags = await connection.query(sql, req.params.id);
          if (flags.length === 0)
            return res.status(404).send({ message: 'flag not found' });

          return res.send({ flags[0] });

        } finally {
          pool.releaseConnection(connection);
        }

      } catch (err) {
        // handle errors here
      }
    });

## Comparison between Promises and Async/Await
Function using promises:

    function myAsyncFunction() {
        return aFunctionThatReturnsAPromise()
               // doSomething is a sync function
               .then(result => doSomething(result))
               .catch(handleError);
    }

So here is when Async/Await enter in action in order to get cleaner our function:

    async function myAsyncFunction() {
      let result;

      try {
          result = await aFunctionThatReturnsAPromise();
      } catch (error) {
          handleError(error);
      }
    
      // doSomething is a sync function
      return doSomething(result);
    }

So the keyword `async` would be similar to write `return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...}`.

And `await` similar to get your result in `then` callback.

Here I leave a pretty brief gif that will not left any doubt in mind after seeing it:

## Progression from Callbacks
In the beginning there were callbacks, and callbacks were ok:

    const getTemperature = (callback) => {
      http.get('www.temperature.com/current', (res) => {
        callback(res.data.temperature)
      })
    }

    const getAirPollution = (callback) => {
      http.get('www.pollution.com/current', (res) => {
        callback(res.data.pollution)
      });
    }

    getTemperature(function(temp) {
      getAirPollution(function(pollution) {
        console.log(`the temp is ${temp} and the pollution is ${pollution}.`)
        // The temp is 27 and the pollution is 0.5.
      })
    })

But there were a few [really frustrating](http://callbackhell.com) issues with callbacks so we all started using promises.

    const getTemperature = () => {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        http.get('www.temperature.com/current', (res) => {
          resolve(res.data.temperature)
        })
      })
    }

    const getAirPollution = () => {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        http.get('www.pollution.com/current', (res) => {
          resolve(res.data.pollution)
        })
      })
    }

    getTemperature()
    .then(temp => console.log(`the temp is ${temp}`))
    .then(() => getAirPollution())
    .then(pollution => console.log(`and the pollution is ${pollution}`))
    // the temp is 32
    // and the pollution is 0.5
   

This was a bit better. Finally, we found async/await. Which still uses promises under the hood.

    const temp = await getTemperature()
    const pollution = await getAirPollution()



## Stops execution at await
If the promise doesn't return anything, the async task can be completed using `await`.

    try{
        await User.findByIdAndUpdate(user._id, {
            $push: {
                tokens: token
            }
        }).exec()
    }catch(e){
        handleError(e)
    }
