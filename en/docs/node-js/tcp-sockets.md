## A simple TCP server
    // Include Nodejs' net module.
    const Net = require('net');
    // The port on which the server is listening.
    const port = 8080;
    
    // Use net.createServer() in your code. This is just for illustration purpose.
    // Create a new TCP server.
    const server = new Net.Server();
    // The server listens to a socket for a client to make a connection request.
    // Think of a socket as an end point.
    server.listen(port, function() {
        console.log(`Server listening for connection requests on socket localhost:${port}`.);
    });

    // When a client requests a connection with the server, the server creates a new
    // socket dedicated to that client.
    server.on('connection', function(socket) {
        console.log('A new connection has been established.');

        // Now that a TCP connection has been established, the server can send data to
        // the client by writing to its socket.
        socket.write('Hello, client.');

        // The server can also receive data from the client by reading from its socket.
        socket.on('data', function(chunk) {
            console.log(`Data received from client: ${chunk.toString()`.});
        });

        // When the client requests to end the TCP connection with the server, the server
        // ends the connection.
        socket.on('end', function() {
            console.log('Closing connection with the client');
        });

        // Don't forget to catch error, for your own sake.
        socket.on('error', function(err) {
            console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
        });
    });

## A simple TCP client
    // Include Nodejs' net module.
    const Net = require('net');
    // The port number and hostname of the server.
    const port = 8080;
    const host = 'localhost';
    
    // Create a new TCP client.
    const client = new Net.Socket();
    // Send a connection request to the server.
    client.connect({ port: port, host: host }), function() {
        // If there is no error, the server has accepted the request and created a new 
        // socket dedicated to us.
        console.log('TCP connection established with the server.');

        // The client can now send data to the server by writing to its socket.
        client.write('Hello, server.');
    });

    // The client can also receive data from the server by reading from its socket.
    client.on('data', function(chunk) {
        console.log(`Data received from the server: ${chunk.toString()}.`);
        
        // Request an end to the connection after the data has been received.
        client.end();
    });

    client.on('end', function() {
        console.log('Requested an end to the TCP connection');
    });
