## Syntax
- const cluster  = require("cluster")
- cluster.fork()
- cluster.isMaster
- cluster.isWorker
- cluster.schedulingPolicy
- cluster.setupMaster(settings)
- cluster.settings
- cluster.worker // in worker
- cluster.workers // in master


Note that `cluster.fork()` spawns a child process that begins executing the current script from the beginning, in contrast to the `fork()` system call in _C_ which clones the current process and continues from the instruction after the system call in both parent and child process.

The Node.js Documentation has a more complete guide to clusters [here](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html)

## Hello World
This is your `cluster.js`:

    const cluster = require('cluster');
    const http = require('http');
    const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;
    
    if (cluster.isMaster) {
      // Fork workers.
      for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();
      }
    
      cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
        console.log(`worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
      });
    } else {
      // Workers can share any TCP connection
      // In this case it is an HTTP server
      require('./server.js')();
    }

This is your main `server.js`:

    const http = require('http');
    
    function startServer() {
        const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
          res.writeHead(200);
          res.end('Hello Http');
        });
    
        server.listen(3000);
    }
    
    if(!module.parent) {
        // Start server if file is run directly
        startServer();
    } else {
        // Export server, if file is referenced via cluster
        module.exports = startServer;
    }

In this example, we host a basic web server, however, we spin up workers (child processes) using the built-in **cluster** module. The number of processes forker depend on the number of CPU cores available. This enables a Node.js application to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, since a single instance of Node.js runs in a single thread. The application will now share the port 8000 across all the processes. Loads will automatically be distributed between workers using the Round-Robin method by default.

## Cluster Example
A single instance of `Node.js` runs in a single thread. To take advantage of multi-core systems, application can be launched in a cluster of Node.js processes to handle the load.

The `cluster` module allows you to easily create child processes that all share server ports.

Following example create the worker child process in main process that handles the load across multiple cores.

**Example**

    const cluster = require('cluster');
    const http = require('http');
    const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length; //number of CPUS

    if (cluster.isMaster) {
      // Fork workers.
      for (var i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        cluster.fork();    //creating child process
      }

      //on exit of cluster
      cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
          if (signal) {
            console.log(`worker was killed by signal: ${signal}`);
          } else if (code !== 0) {
            console.log(`worker exited with error code: ${code}`);
          } else {
            console.log('worker success!');
          }
      });
    } else {
      // Workers can share any TCP connection
      // In this case it is an HTTP server
      http.createServer((req, res) => {
        res.writeHead(200);
        res.end('hello world\n');
      }).listen(3000);
    }
