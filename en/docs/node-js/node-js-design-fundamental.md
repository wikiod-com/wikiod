## The Node.js philosophy
 **Small Core**, **Small Module** :- 

Build small and single purpose modules not in term of code size only, but also in term of scope that serves a single purpose

        a - "Small is beautiful"
        b - "Make each program do one thing well."

 
**The Reactor Pattern**

The Reactor Pattern is the heart of the `node.js` asynchronous nature. Allowed the system to be implemented as a single-threaded process with a series of event generators and event handlers, with the help of event loop that runs continuously.

**The non-blocking I/O engine of Node.js â€“ libuv** - 

**The Observer Pattern**(EventEmitter) 
maintains a list of dependents/observers and notifies them




    var events = require('events');
    var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
    
    var ringBell = function ringBell()
    {
      console.log('tring tring tring');
    }
    eventEmitter.on('doorOpen', ringBell);
    
    eventEmitter.emit('doorOpen');
