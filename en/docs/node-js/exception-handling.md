## Handling Exception In Node.Js
Node.js has 3 basic ways to handle exceptions/errors:

 1. **try**-**catch** block
 2. **error** as the first argument to a `callback`
 3. `emit` an **error** event using eventEmitter


**try-catch** is used to catch the exceptions thrown from the synchronous code execution. If the caller (or the caller's caller, ...) used try/catch, then they can catch the error. If none of the callers had try-catch than the program crashes.  
If using try-catch on an async operation and exception was thrown from callback of async method than it will not get caught by try-catch. To catch an exception from async operation callback, it is preferred to use *promises*.  
Example to understand it better

    // ** Example - 1  **
    function doSomeSynchronousOperation(req, res) {
        if(req.body.username === ''){
            throw new Error('User Name cannot be empty');
        }  
        return true;  
    }
    
    // calling the method above
    try {
        // synchronous code   
        doSomeSynchronousOperation(req, res)    
    catch(e) {
        //exception handled here   
        console.log(e.message);  
    } 
   
    // ** Example - 2 **
    function doSomeAsynchronousOperation(req, res, cb) {
        // imitating async operation
        return setTimeout(function(){
            cb(null, []);
        },1000);
    }
     
    try {
        // asynchronous code   
        doSomeAsynchronousOperation(req, res, function(err, rs){
            throw new Error("async operation exception");
        })   
    } catch(e) {
         // Exception will not get handled here
         console.log(e.message);  
    }
    // The exception is unhandled and hence will cause application to break


**callbacks** are mostly used in Node.js as callback delivers an event asynchronously. The user passes you a function (the callback), and you invoke it sometime later when the asynchronous operation completes.  
The usual pattern is that the callback is invoked as a *callback(err, result)*, where only one of err and result is non-null, depending on whether the operation succeeded or failed.

    function doSomeAsynchronousOperation(req, res, callback) {
       setTimeout(function(){
            return callback(new Error('User Name cannot be empty'));    
       }, 1000);  
       return true;
    }
  
    doSomeAsynchronousOperation(req, res, function(err, result) {
       if (err) {
           //exception handled here 
           console.log(err.message);
       }
       
       //do some stuff with valid data
    });

**emit** For more complicated cases, instead of using a callback, the function itself can return an EventEmitter object, and the caller would be expected to listen for error events on the emitter.

    const EventEmitter = require('events');
    
    function doSomeAsynchronousOperation(req, res) {
        let myEvent = new EventEmitter();
    
        // runs asynchronously
        setTimeout(function(){
            myEvent.emit('error', new Error('User Name cannot be empty'));
        }, 1000);
    
        return myEvent;
    }
    
    // Invoke the function
    let event = doSomeAsynchronousOperation(req, res);
    
    event.on('error', function(err) {
        console.log(err);
    });
    
    event.on('done', function(result) {
        console.log(result); // true
    });

## Unhanded Exception Management
Because Node.js runs on a single process uncaught exceptions are an issue to be aware of when developing applications.

## Silently Handling Exceptions ##

Most of the people let node.js server(s) silently swallow up the errors.

 - Silently handling the exception


    process.on('uncaughtException', function (err) {
      console.log(err);
    });

**This is bad**, it will work but:

 -    Root cause will remains unknown, as such will not contribute to resolution of what caused the Exception ( Error ).

 - In case of database connection ( pool ) gets closed for some reason this will result in constant propagation of errors, meaning that server will be running but it will not reconnect to db.


----------


## Returning to Initial state  ## 

In case of an " uncaughtException " it is good to restart the server and return it to its **initial state**, where we know it will work. Exception is logged, application is terminated but since it will be running in a container that will make sure that the server is running we will achieve restarting of the server ( returning to the initial working state ) .

- Installing the forever ( or other CLI tool to make sure that node server runs continuously )


    npm install forever -g

- Starting the server in forever


    forever start app.js

> Reason why is it started and why we use forever is after the server is
> **terminated** forever process will start the server again.

- Restarting the server


    process.on('uncaughtException', function (err) {
        console.log(err);
 
        // some logging mechanisam
        // ....        

        process.exit(1); // terminates process
    });


----------


On a side note there was a way also to handle exceptions with **Clusters and Domains**.

Domains are deprecated more information [here][1].

## Errors and Promises
Promises handle errors differently to synchronous or callback-driven code.

    const p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        reject(new Error('Oops'));
    });
    
    // anything that is `reject`ed inside a promise will be available through catch
    // while a promise is rejected, `.then` will not be called
    p
        .then(() => {
            console.log("won't be called");
        })
        .catch(e => {
            console.log(e.message); // output: Oops
        })
        // once the error is caught, execution flow resumes
        .then(() => {
            console.log('hello!'); // output: hello!
        });

currently, errors thrown in a promise that are not caught results in the error being swallowed, which can make it difficult to track down the error. This can be [solved](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-promise) using linting tools like [eslint](http://eslint.org/) or by ensuring you always have a `catch` clause.

This behaviour is deprecated [in node 8](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/deprecations.html#deprecations_dep0018_unhandled_promise_rejections) in favour of terminating the node process.
