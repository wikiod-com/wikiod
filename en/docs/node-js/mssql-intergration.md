To integrate any database with nodejs you need a driver package or you can call it a npm module which will provide you with basic API to connect with the database and perform interactions . 
Same is true with mssql database , here we will integrate mssql with nodejs and perform some basic queries on SQL tabels.

We have assumed that we will have a local instance of mssql database server running on local machine . You can refer [this document][1] to do the same .

Also make sure you appropriate user created with privileges added as well.

## Connecting with SQL via. mssql npm module
We will start with creating a simple node application with a basic structure and then connecting with local sql server database and performing some queries on that database.

**Step 1:** Create a directory/folder by the name of project which you intent to create. Initialize a node application using *npm init* command which will create a package.json in current directory .

    mkdir mySqlApp
    //folder created 
    cd mwSqlApp
    //change to newly created directory
    npm init
    //answer all the question ..
    npm install
    //This will complete quickly since we have not added any packages to our app.

 **Step 2:** Now we will create a App.js file in this directory and install some packages which we are going to need to connect to sql db. 

    sudo gedit App.js
    //This will create App.js file , you can use your fav. text editor :)
    npm install --save mssql
    //This will install the mssql package to you app

 **Step 3:** Now we will add a basic configuration variable to our application which will be used by mssql module to establish a connection .

    console.log("Hello world, This is an app to connect to sql server.");
    var config = {
            "user": "myusername", //default is sa
            "password": "yourStrong(!)Password",
            "server": "localhost", // for local machine
            "database": "staging", // name of database
            "options": {
                "encrypt": true
            }
          }
    
    sql.connect(config, err => { 
        if(err){
            throw err ;
        }
        console.log("Connection Successful !");

        new sql.Request().query('select 1 as number', (err, result) => {
            //handle err
            console.dir(result)
            // This example uses callbacks strategy for getting results.
        })
            
    });
    
    sql.on('error', err => {
        // ... error handler 
        console.log("Sql database connection error " ,err);
    })

**Step 4:** This is the easiest step ,where we start the application and the application will connect to the sql server and print out some simple results .

    node App.js
    // Output : 
    // Hello world, This is an app to connect to sql server.
    // Connection Successful !
    // 1
