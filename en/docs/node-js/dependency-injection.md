## Why Use Dependency Injection
 1. **Fast Development process**
 2. **Decoupling** 
 3. **Unit test writing** 
<br><br>

**Fast Development process**<br>
When using dependency injection node developer can faster their development proceess because after DI there is less code conflict and easy to manage all module.<br>

**Decoupling**<br>
Modules becomes less couple then it is easy to maintain.

**Unit test writing**<br>
Hardcoded dependencies can pass them into the module then easy to write unit test for each module.
