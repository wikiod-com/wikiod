## Using a simple module in node.js
What is a node.js module ([link to article][1]):

>A module encapsulates related code into a single unit of code. When creating a module, this can be interpreted as moving all related functions into a file. 

Now lets see an example. Imagine all files are in same directory:

File: `printer.js`

    "use strict";
    
    exports.printHelloWorld = function (){
        console.log("Hello World!!!");
    }

Another way of using modules:
 
File `animals.js`

    "use strict";

    module.exports = {
        lion: function() {
            console.log("ROAARR!!!");
        }
    
    };

File: `app.js`

Run this file by going to your directory and typing: `node app.js`

    "use strict";
    
    //require('./path/to/module.js') node which module to load
    var printer = require('./printer');
    var animals = require('./animals');
    
    printer.printHelloWorld(); //prints "Hello World!!!"
    animals.lion(); //prints "ROAARR!!!"

## Exporting with ES6 syntax
This is the equivalent of [the other example](https://www.wikiod.com/node-js/exporting-and-importing-module-in-nodejs#Using a simple module in node.js) but using ES6 instead.

    export function printHelloWorld() {
      console.log("Hello World!!!");
    }

## Using Imports In ES6
Node.js is built against modern versions of V8. By keeping up-to-date with the latest releases of this engine, we ensure new features from the JavaScript ECMA-262 specification are brought to Node.js developers in a timely manner, as well as continued performance and stability improvements.

All ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) features are split into three groups for shipping, staged, and in progress features:

All shipping features, which V8 considers stable, are turned on by default on Node.js and do NOT require any kind of runtime flag.
Staged features, which are almost-completed features that are not considered stable by the V8 team, require a runtime flag: --harmony.
In progress features can be activated individually by their respective harmony flag, although this is highly discouraged unless for testing purposes. Note: these flags are exposed by V8 and will potentially change without any deprecation notice.




Currently ES6 supports import statements natively [Refer here][1]

So if we have a file called `fun.js`…

    export default function say(what){
      console.log(what);
    }
    
    export function sayLoud(whoot) {
      say(whoot.toUpperCase());
    }

…and if there was another file named `app.js` where we want to put our previously defined functions to use, there are three ways how to import them.

**Import default**

    import say from './fun';
    say('Hello Stack Overflow!!');  // Output: Hello Stack Overflow!!
Imports the `say()` function because it is marked as the default export in the source file (`export default …`)

**Named imports**

    import { sayLoud } from './fun';
    sayLoud('JS modules are awesome.'); // Output: JS MODULES ARE AWESOME.

Named imports allow us to import exactly the parts of a module we actually need. We do this by explicitly naming them. In our case by naming `sayLoud` in curly brackets within the import statement.

**Bundled import**

    import * as i from './fun';
    i.say('What?'); // Output: What?
    i.sayLoud('Whoot!'); // Output: WHOOT!

If we want to have it all, this is the way to go. By using the syntax `* as i` we have the `import` statement provide us with an object `i` that holds all exports of our `fun` module as correspondingly named properties.

***Paths***

Keep in mind that you have to explicitly mark your import paths as *relative paths* even if the file to be imported resided in the same directory like the file you are importing into by using `./`. Imports from unprefixed paths like

    import express from 'express';

will be looked up in the local and global `node_modules` folders and will throw an error if no matching modules are found.
