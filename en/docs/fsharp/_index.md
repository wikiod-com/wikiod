F# is a "functional-first" language. You can learn about all of the different [types of expressions](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/f%23/3559/types/12282/introduction-to-types#t=201607291550138973242), along with [functions](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/f%23/2525/functions/8352/basics-of-functions#t=201607291552183945256).

The F# compiler -- [which is open source](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp#the-open-edition-of-the-f-compiler-core-library--tools) -- compiles your programs into IL, which means that you can use F# code from any .NET compatible language such as [C#](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%23/topics); and run it on Mono, [.NET Core](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/f%23/4404/f-on-net-core#t=201607291554043257071), or the .NET Framework on Windows.
