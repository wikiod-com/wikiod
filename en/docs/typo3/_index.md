**TYPO3** is a PHP web content management system written, boasting extensions, advanced localization, scalability, and its open source nature. By making a distinction between the frontend and the backend, content visible to site visitors and administrators is innately abstracted. TYPO3 makes heavy use of extensions to supplement the core features with common, compartmentalized enhancements.
