## Installation or Setup
There are binary installer for pandoc available for Windows and MacOS, as well as a debian package, available [for the latest release](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest). There are usually not up-to-date versions of pandoc in ["Debian, Ubuntu, Slackware, Arch, Fedora, NiXOS, openSUSE, and gentoo"](http://pandoc.org/installing.html#linux) repositories.

A reliable way to get the latest version if binaries are not an option is to [compile from source](http://pandoc.org/installing.html#quick-stack-method), using either `stack` or `cabal`.
