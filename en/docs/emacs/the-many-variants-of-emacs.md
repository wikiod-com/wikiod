Most of this documentation implicitly or explicitly applies to GNU Emacs.  This may be the most well known variant of Emacs, as well as the source of several forks, and the target of some merges.

This topic discusses some of the variants of Emacs one may encounter, and their primary differences from GNU Emacs.

## Spacemacs
Spacemacs (http://spacemacs.org/) is a variant of Emacs that attempts to end the long-term conflict between Emacs and vim users, by making an Emacs that behaves like vim.
