# What is Electron?

Electron is an **open-source framework**, which is used to create desktop applications using [**HTML**](https://www.wikiod.com/html), [**CSS**](https://www.wikiod.com/css) and [**JavaScript**](https://www.wikiod.com/javascript). In the inside, it works thanks to **Chromium** and [**Node.js**](https://www.wikiod.com/node-js).

Its original creator, [GitHub](https://github.com), works with a wide community of developers to maintain the project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/electron/electron).

One of the main perks of using Electron is that, since it's based in web technologies, it's **cross platform**, allowing to deploy applications for Linux, MacOS and Windows, with the same code.

It also features native elements such as menus and notifications, as well as useful developing tools for debugging and crash reporting.
