*PyQt is a GUI widgets toolkit. It is a Python interface for Qt, one of the most powerful, and popular cross-platform GUI library. PyQt is a blend of Python programming language and the Qt library. This introductory tutorial will assist you in creating graphical applications with the help of PyQt.*
