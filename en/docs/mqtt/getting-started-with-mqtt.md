## Introduction
MQTT(Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a [Publish-Subscribe][4] based "lightweight" messaging protocol for use on top of the [TCP/IP][5] stack.

> It is quite useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. 

There are many different Brokers and Clients that implement the MQTT protocol.

A list of Brokers, Clients and Tools can be found on the mqtt.org website [here][1], while it is not definitive it does offer a representative sample. There is also a curated list on [github.com][3] on MQTT.

News on MQTT specifications can be found at [mqtt.org](http://mqtt.org).

MQTT v3.1.1 is an Oasis standard available [here][2]
