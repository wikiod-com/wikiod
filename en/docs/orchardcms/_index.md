Orchard is a free, open source, community-focused Content Management System built on the ASP.NET MVC platform.

Orchard is built on a modern architecture that puts extensibility up-front, as its number one concern. All components in Orchard can be replaced or extended. Content is built from easily composable building blocks. Modules extend the system in a very decoupled fashion, where a commenting module for example can as easily apply to pages, blog posts, photos or products. A rich UI composition system completes the picture and ensures that you can get the exact presentation that you need for your content.

Orchard is delivered under the .NET Foundation. It is licensed under a New BSD license, which is approved by the OSI.

Our mission is to empower our users and foster a dedicated and diverse community that builds the CMS that we all want to use.

This section provides an overview of what orchardcms is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within orchardcms, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for orchardcms is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
