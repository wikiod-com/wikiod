Xamarin.iOS allows you to create native iOS applications using the same UI controls you would in Objective-C and Xcode, but with the flexibility and elegance of a modern language (C#), the power of the .NET Base Class Library (BCL), and two first-class IDEs - Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio - at your fingertips.

For more information on installing Xamarin.iOS on your Mac or Windows machine, refer to the [Getting Started][1] guides on the Xamarin developer center
