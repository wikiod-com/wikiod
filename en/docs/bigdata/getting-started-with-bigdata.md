## Big Data example
Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate to deal with them. Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, querying, updating and information privacy.


A general example of big data:

Data collected by social networking site facebook. Facebook collects hundreds of terabytes(TB) of data every day. Data collected may be images, videos, posts, updates, etc. The data varies from structured to unstructured. A like, share or reaction maybe structured data as we clearly know the structure of it. Whereas updates or posts are unstructured data which don't exactly follow a structure. All this data together forms BigData!



## What is Big Data?
Big Data, in its most basic form, can be described as the umbrella term metricized by different aspects of data. These different aspects are

> Volume(Huge quantity of Data), Velocity(Greater dataflow speeds), Variety(Structured, Unstructured and Semi-structured Data) and Veracity(Making right decisions based on data).

These metrics were hard to be taken care of by old age relational databases. A need for a new system arose and Big Data processing came to the rescue. 
While many people have different understanding on what Big Data is, here  are few of the definitions of Big Data given by industry leaders in Data sector:
 
**Definitions:**

 - “Big data exceeds the reach of commonly used hardware environments
   and software  tools to capture, manage, and process it with in a
   tolerable elapsed time for its user  population.”  (Teradata
   Magazine article, 2011)
 - “Big data refers to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of
   typical database software  tools to capture, store, manage and
   analyze.” (The McKinsey Global Institute,  2012)
 - “Big data is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it
   becomes difficult to  process using on-hand database management
   tools.” (Wikipedia,  2014)
 - "Big Data are high-­‐volume,high-­‐velocity,and/or high-­‐variety
   information assets that require new forms of processing to enable
   enhanced decision making,insight recovery and process optimization"
   (Gartner,2012)

## What Comes Under Big Data?
Big data involves the data produced by different devices and applications. Given below are some of the fields that come under the umbrella of Big Data.
 
 - Black Box Data : It is a component of helicopter, airplanes, and
   jets, etc. It captures voices of the flight crew, recordings of
   microphones and earphones, and the performance information of the
   aircraft.

  
 - Social Media Data : Social media such as Facebook and Twitter hold
   information and the views posted by millions of people across the
   globe.

   
 - Stock Exchange Data : The stock exchange data holds information about
   the ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ decisions made on a share of different companies
   made by the customers.

 - Power Grid Data : The power grid data holds information consumed by a
   particular node with respect to a base station.   

 - Transport Data : Transport data includes model, capacity, distance
   and availability of a vehicle.

 - Search Engine Data : Search engines retrieve lots of data from
   different databases.

 - Sensor Data : Data from different devices working on sensors, example: Meteorological (weather and climate) data, Seismic (earthquake) data, Oceanic (Tides, Tsunami etc.) data.

Thus Big Data includes huge volume, high velocity, and extensible variety of data. The data in it will be of three types.

    1. Structured data : Mostly data from Relational Databases.

    2. Semi Structured data : XML data, email data.

    3. Unstructured data : Word, PDF, Text, Media Logs.
