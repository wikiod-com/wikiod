Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and its Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

Jekyll's website is at http://jekyllrb.com/, and documentation can be found at http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/.
