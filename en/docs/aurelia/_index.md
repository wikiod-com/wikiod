Aurelia is a modular modern front-end Javascript framework for building browser, mobile and desktop applications built on open web standards. Rather than being an all inclusive framework, Aurelia adopts a feature-per-module approach to its architecture. Any piece of Aurelia is replaceable with a third-party dependency (or removed altogether).

Unlike competing frameworks such as Angular, Aurelia's core philosophy is to abide by official web standards and DOM API's, this ensures more bare-metal performance as it sits closer to native API's and has very little abstraction. Your views are HTML, your view-models are Javascript (or TypeScript) and Aurelia's component model is based on W3C Web Components HTML Templates and ShadowDOM, so your code mirrors that of a real emerging web standard.

Even though Aurelia is a fully-featured single page application framework, the learning curve is a lot lower than existing alternatives like Angular and Ember. Its templating syntax is intuitive and shares similarities with previous frameworks and libraries you might have worked with.

A developer or company might opt to use Aurelia over other solutions because standards matter to them and writing abstract framework-specific boilerplate code does not feel right to you and you're looking for a framework that prefers to let native DOM API's do the work for you.
