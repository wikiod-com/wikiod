## Official Packages
## Cashier
Laravel Cashier provides an expressive, fluent interface to [Stripe's](https://stripe.com/au) and [Braintree's](https://www.braintreepayments.com) subscription billing services. It handles almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading writing. In addition to basic subscription management, Cashier can handle coupons, swapping subscription, subscription "quantities", cancellation grace periods, and even generate invoice PDFs.

More about this package can be found [here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/billing).

## Envoy
Laravel Envoy provides a clean, minimal syntax for defining common tasks you run on your remote servers. Using Blade style syntax, you can easily setup tasks for deployment, Artisan commands, and more. Currently, Envoy only supports the Mac and Linux operating systems.

This package can be found on [Github](https://github.com/laravel/envoy).

## Passport
Laravel already makes it easy to perform authentication via traditional login forms, but what about APIs? APIs typically use tokens to authenticate users and do not maintain session state between requests. Laravel makes API authentication a breeze using Laravel Passport, which provides a full OAuth2 server implementation for your Laravel application in a matter of minutes.

More about this package can be found [here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/passport).

## Scout
Laravel Scout provides a simple, driver-based solution for adding full-text search to your Eloquent models. Using model observers, Scout will automatically keep your search indexes in sync with your Eloquent records.

Currently, Scout ships with an Algolia driver; however, writing custom drivers is simple and you are free to extend Scout with your own search implementations.
