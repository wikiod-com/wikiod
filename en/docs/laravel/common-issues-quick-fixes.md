This section lists the common issues & quick fixes developers (especially beginners) face.

## TokenMisMatch Exception
You get this exception mostly with form submissions. Laravel protects application from `CSRF` and validates every request and ensures the request originated from within the application. This validation is done using a `token`. If this token mismatches this exception is generated.


**Quick Fix**

Add this within your form element. This sends `csrf_token` generated by laravel along with other form data so laravel knows that your request is valid 

    <input type="hidden" name="_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}">
