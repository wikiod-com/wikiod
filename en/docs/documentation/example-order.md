## Pinned example
One example per topic may be pinned by clicking the pin icon in the bottom left corner of the example. So long as a topic is pinned, it will stay at the top of a topic's example collection.

## Votes
Aside from pinned examples, it is not possible to enforce the order of examples. Instead, order is naturally selected in descending order of total votes. The most popular example will therefore bubble to the top of the collection of examples.
