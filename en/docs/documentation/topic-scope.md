Topics should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. This one suggests some organizing principles seen on Stack Overflow Documentation.

## Language feature Topics
A natural division is simply to make one topic for each language feature. For instance, [Python](https://www.wikiod.com/python) has:

* Classes
* Functions
* Generators
* Decorators
* . . .

On the downside, features can be quite complicated and it's easy to come up with many more examples than make sense for a single page. [Classes](https://www.wikiod.com/python/classes) has 16 examples, for instance. Some of those could probably be moved to other feature topics, such as Inheritance, Properties, Methods, etc. 


## Grab bag Topics
Some topics are loosely associated examples under a theme, such as [C# 6.0 Features](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c%23/24/c-sharp-6-0-features#t=201612230039539131488) and [Common pitfalls](https://www.wikiod.com/docs/c/2006/common-pitfalls#t=201612230051221917827). On the whole, this style of topic has been discouraged since examples per topic were [limited](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/333420/1438) as there's no natural place to stop adding content.

It's probably better to move the examples to another Topic (perhaps for [language features](https://www.wikiod.com/8361)). I haven't seen this done, but it's possible these topics could be converted into a meta topic that includes an example or two that consists largely of links to other topics or examples:

> # Perl Tips and Tricks
>
> * Don't parse XML with a regex! Use [an XML parsing module](https://www.wikiod.com/perl/xml-parsing).
> * If you need to comment out whole blocks of code, use a [POD comment block](https://www.wikiod.com/perl/comments#Multi-line comments).
> * . . .
