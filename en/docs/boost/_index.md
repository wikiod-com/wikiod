### What is Boost?

Boost is a large collection of free, high quality C++ libraries that cover a broad range of topics. It is often considered a "second standard library" for C++, since many common problems in C++ are solved by using Boost.

From [boost.org][1]:
> Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.
>
> We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use.

Some Boost libraries have even [made their way][5] into the C++11 standard library, and some other, such as [Boost.Optional][2] and [Boost.Variant][3], will be a part of C++17.


  ### What can Boost do?

Boost covers most corners of programming. From the [boost tag wiki][4] here on Stack Overflow:
