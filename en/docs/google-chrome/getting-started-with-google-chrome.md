## Installation or Setup
**Install Chrome** by first considering which **version** to use, relevant if you are going to be doing Web Development:

Google Chrome releases major versions about every 6 weeks and provides access to multiple versions of the product as they are being stabilized. This process is done in a series of [channels][1].

 - **[Stable Channel][2]** is the version released to all users, it is the default installation experience. It receives security updates as needed.
 - **Beta Channel** is where the next major version is stabilized for approximately 1 month before moving to Stable. It is updated roughly weekly.
 - **Dev Channel** is very close to the latest code, with minimal testing. It is updated 1 or 2 times a week.

A desktop installation of chrome can be moved from Stable to Beta or Dev in Chrome's preferences.

The **[Canary][3]** build undergoes minimal testing and is released daily. It provides access to the latest code and can be installed at the same time as a stable, beta, and dev versions of Chrome.

**Install** by following links to your choice of [Stable][2] (and then modifying it to Beta or Dev) or [Canary][3]. On Android and iOS, use the respective Play / App Store.

1. Downloading Chrome For [PC/Mac/Linux](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

2.  Click "Download Chrome". This will open the Terms of Service window.

    -  You can opt to send usage data back to Google by checking the box labeled “Help make Google Chrome better…” This will send back crash reports, preferences and button clicks. ***It does not send any personal information or track websites.***

4. Click “Accept and Install” after reading the Terms of Service.
 The installer will start and you will have Google Chrome installed when it has finished.
