_For HTML lists see [html-list][1]._

_The current [list tag-info][2] also mentions a lot about lists of expressions joined by logical (short-circuiting) operators._

Lists are a construct provided by, or created in, many programming languages and environments (especially if they provide [generics][3]) grouping same-typed objects, with an order and so often available by index, but normally without a maximum length. They are one of fundamental [collections][4].

Possible subtopics:
* Types of lists
