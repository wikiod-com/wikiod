## Difference between GROUP BY and DISTINCT
`GROUP BY` is used in combination with aggregation functions. Consider the following table:

| orderId | userId | storeName | orderValue | orderDate |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | 43 | Store A   | 25 | 20-03-2016 |
| 2   | 57 | Store B   | 50 | 22-03-2016 |
| 3   | 43 | Store A   | 30 | 25-03-2016 |
| 4   | 82 |Store C   | 10 | 26-03-2016 |
| 5   | 21 |Store A   | 45 | 29-03-2016 |

The query below uses `GROUP BY` to perform aggregated calculations.

    SELECT
        storeName,
        COUNT(*) AS total_nr_orders,
        COUNT(DISTINCT userId) AS nr_unique_customers,
        AVG(orderValue) AS average_order_value,
        MIN(orderDate) AS first_order,
        MAX(orderDate) AS lastOrder
    FROM
        orders
    GROUP BY
        storeName;






and will return the following information


| storeName | total_nr_orders  |nr_unique_customers | average_order_value | first_order | lastOrder |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Store A   | 3 | 2   | 33.3 | 20-03-2016 | 29-03-2016 |
| Store B   | 1 | 1   | 50 | 22-03-2016 | 22-03-2016 |
| Store C   | 1 | 1   | 10 | 26-03-2016 | 26-03-2016 |

While `DISTINCT` is used to list a unique combination of distinct values for the specified columns. 

    SELECT DISTINCT
        storeName,
        userId
    FROM
        orders;


| storeName| userId|
| ------ | ------ |
| Store A   | 43   | 
| Store B   | 57   |
| Store C   | 82   |
| Store A   | 21   |
