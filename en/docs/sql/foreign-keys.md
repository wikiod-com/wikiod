## Creating a table with a foreign key
In this example we have an existing table, `SuperHeros`.

This table contains a primary key `ID`.

We will add a new table in order to store the powers of each super hero:

    CREATE TABLE HeroPowers
    (
        ID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        Name nvarchar(MAX) NOT NULL,
        HeroId int REFERENCES SuperHeros(ID)
    )

The column `HeroId` is a **foreign key** to the table `SuperHeros`.

## Foreign Keys explained
Foreign Keys constraints ensure data integrity, by enforcing that values in one table must match values in another table.

An example of where a foreign key is required is: In a university, a course must belong to a department. Code for the this scenario is: 

    CREATE TABLE Department (
        Dept_Code        CHAR (5)     PRIMARY KEY,
        Dept_Name        VARCHAR (20) UNIQUE
    );

Insert values with the following statement: 

    INSERT INTO Department VALUES ('CS205', 'Computer Science');

The following table will contain the information of the subjects offered by the Computer science branch:

    CREATE TABLE Programming_Courses (
        Dept_Code       CHAR(5),
        Prg_Code        CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY,
        Prg_Name        VARCHAR (50) UNIQUE,
        FOREIGN KEY (Dept_Code) References Department(Dept_Code)
    );

(The data type of the Foreign Key must match the datatype of the referenced key.)

The Foreign Key constraint on the column `Dept_Code` allows values only if they already exist in the referenced table, `Department`. This means that if you try to insert the following values:

    INSERT INTO Programming_Courses Values ('CS300', 'FDB-DB001', 'Database Systems');

the database will raise a Foreign Key violation error, because `CS300` does not exist in the `Department` table. But when you try a key value that exists:

    INSERT INTO Programming_Courses VALUES ('CS205', 'FDB-DB001', 'Database Systems');
    INSERT INTO Programming_Courses VALUES ('CS205', 'DB2-DB002', 'Database Systems II');

then the database allows these values.

# A few tips for using Foreign Keys

- A Foreign Key must reference a UNIQUE (or PRIMARY) key in the parent table.
- Entering a NULL value in a Foreign Key column does not raise an error.
- Foreign Key constraints can reference tables within the same database.
- Foreign Key constraints can refer to another column in the same table (self-reference).
