In database management an aggregate function is a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together as input on certain criteria to form a single value of more significant meaning or measurement such as a set, a bag or a list.

    MIN        returns the smallest value in a given column
    MAX        returns the largest value in a given column
    SUM        returns the sum of the numeric values in a given column
    AVG        returns the average value of a given column
    COUNT      returns the total number of values in a given column
    COUNT(*)   returns the number of rows in a table
    GROUPING   Is a column or an expression that contains a column in a GROUP BY clause.
    STDEV      returns the statistical standard deviation of all values in the specified expression.
    STDEVP     returns the statistical standard deviation for the population for all values in the specified expression.
    VAR        returns the statistical variance of all values in the specified expression. may be followed by the OVER clause.
    VARP       returns the statistical variance for the population for all values in the specified expression.

All aggregate functions ignore NULL values.



## Conditional aggregation
Payments Table

|  Customer  |  Payment_type  |  Amount   |
| ------     | ------         |-----------|
|  Peter     | Credit         |  100      |
|  Peter     | Credit         |  300      |
|  John      | Credit         |  1000     |
|  John      | Debit          |  500      |


    select customer, 
           sum(case when payment_type = 'credit' then amount else 0 end) as credit,
           sum(case when payment_type = 'debit' then amount else 0 end) as debit
    from payments
    group by customer

Result:

|  Customer  |  Credit   |  Debit  |
| ------     |-----------|---------|
|  Peter     |  400      |  0      |
|  John      |  1000     |  500    |


    select customer, 
           sum(case when payment_type = 'credit' then 1 else 0 end) as credit_transaction_count,
           sum(case when payment_type = 'debit' then 1 else 0 end) as debit_transaction_count
    from payments
    group by customer

Result:

|  Customer  |  credit_transaction_count|  debit_transaction_count |
| ------     |-----------|--------|
|  Peter     |  2        | 0 |
|  John      |  1        | 1 |


## List Concatenation
Partial credit to [this][1] SO answer.

List Concatenation aggregates a column or expression by combining the values into a single string for each group. A string to delimit each value (either blank or a comma when omitted) and the order of the values in the result can be specified. While it is not part of the SQL standard, every major relational database vendor supports it in their own way.

# MySQL

    SELECT ColumnA
         , GROUP_CONCAT(ColumnB ORDER BY ColumnB SEPARATOR ',') AS ColumnBs
      FROM TableName
     GROUP BY ColumnA
     ORDER BY ColumnA;

# Oracle & DB2

    SELECT ColumnA
         , LISTAGG(ColumnB, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ColumnB) AS ColumnBs
      FROM TableName
     GROUP BY ColumnA
     ORDER BY ColumnA;

# PostgreSQL

    SELECT ColumnA
         , STRING_AGG(ColumnB, ',' ORDER BY ColumnB) AS ColumnBs
      FROM TableName
     GROUP BY ColumnA
     ORDER BY ColumnA;

# SQL Server

## SQL Server 2016 and earlier

(CTE included to encourage the [DRY principle][2])

      WITH CTE_TableName AS (
           SELECT ColumnA, ColumnB
             FROM TableName)
    SELECT t0.ColumnA
         , STUFF((
           SELECT ',' + t1.ColumnB
             FROM CTE_TableName t1
            WHERE t1.ColumnA = t0.ColumnA
            ORDER BY t1.ColumnB
              FOR XML PATH('')), 1, 1, '') AS ColumnBs
      FROM CTE_TableName t0
     GROUP BY t0.ColumnA
     ORDER BY ColumnA;

## SQL Server 2017 and SQL Azure

    SELECT ColumnA
         , STRING_AGG(ColumnB, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ColumnB) AS ColumnBs
      FROM TableName
     GROUP BY ColumnA
     ORDER BY ColumnA;


# SQLite

without ordering:

    SELECT ColumnA
         , GROUP_CONCAT(ColumnB, ',') AS ColumnBs
      FROM TableName
     GROUP BY ColumnA
     ORDER BY ColumnA;

ordering requires a subquery or CTE:

      WITH CTE_TableName AS (
           SELECT ColumnA, ColumnB
             FROM TableName
            ORDER BY ColumnA, ColumnB)
    SELECT ColumnA
         , GROUP_CONCAT(ColumnB, ',') AS ColumnBs
      FROM CTE_TableName
     GROUP BY ColumnA
     ORDER BY ColumnA;

## SUM
`Sum` function sum the value of all the rows in the group. If the group by clause is omitted then sums all the rows.

    select sum(salary) TotalSalary
    from employees;

| TotalSalary|
| ------ | 
| 2500   | 

    select DepartmentId, sum(salary) TotalSalary
    from employees
    group by DepartmentId;

| DepartmentId | TotalSalary|
| ------ | --- |
| 1 | 2000   | 
|2  | 500  |


## AVG()
The aggregate function AVG() returns the average of a given expression, usually numeric values in a column. Assume we have a table containing the yearly calculation of population in cities across the world. The records for New York City look similar to the ones below:

EXAMPLE TABLE
-------------

| city_name     | population| year |
| ------        | ------    | ---- |
| New York City | 8,550,405 | 2015 |
| New York City | ...       | ...  |
| New York City | 8,000,906 | 2005 |

To select the average population of the New York City, USA from a table containing city names, population measurements, and measurement years for last ten years:

QUERY
-----

    select city_name, AVG(population) avg_population
    from city_population
    where city_name = 'NEW YORK CITY';

Notice how measurement year is absent from the query since population is being averaged over time.

RESULTS
-------

| city_name| avg_population|
| ------ | ------ |
| New York City| 8,250,754|

> Note: The AVG() function will convert values to numeric types. This is especially important to keep in mind when working with dates.



## Count
You can count the number of rows:

    SELECT count(*) TotalRows
    FROM employees;

| TotalRows |
|-----|
|4|

Or count the employees per department:

    SELECT DepartmentId, count(*) NumEmployees
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY DepartmentId;

| DepartmentId | NumEmployees |
| ----- | ------|
1 | 3|
2 | 1 |

You can count over a column/expression with the effect that will not count the `NULL` values:

    SELECT count(ManagerId) mgr
    FROM EMPLOYEES;

| mgr |
|-----|
| 3|

(There is one null value managerID column)



You can also use **DISTINCT** inside of another function such as **COUNT** to only find the **DISTINCT** members of the set to perform the operation on.

For example:

   

     SELECT COUNT(ContinentCode) AllCount
     ,      COUNT(DISTINCT ContinentCode) SingleCount
     FROM Countries;

Will return different values. The *SingleCount* will only Count individual Continents once, while the *AllCount* will include duplicates.


| ContinentCode|
| ------ 
| OC|
| EU|
| AS|
| NA|
| NA|
| AF|
| AF|


AllCount: 7
SingleCount: 5


## Max
Find the maximum value of column:

    select max(age) from employee;

Above example will return largest value for column `age` of `employee` table.


Syntax:

    SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;

## Min
Find the smallest value of column:

     select min(age) from employee;

Above example will return smallest value for column `age` of `employee` table.

Syntax:

     SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
