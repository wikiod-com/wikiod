Stored Procedures are SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed or called in queries. Using a stored procedure allows encapsulation of complicated or frequently used logic, and improves query performance by utilizing cached query plans. They can return any value a standard query can return.

Other benefits over dynamic SQL expressions are listed on [Wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure#Comparison_with_dynamic_SQL).

## Create and call a stored procedure
Stored procedures can be created through a database management GUI ([SQL Server example](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345415.aspx)), or through a SQL statement as follows:

    -- Define a name and parameters
    CREATE PROCEDURE Northwind.getEmployee
        @LastName nvarchar(50),   
        @FirstName nvarchar(50)   
    AS   
    
    -- Define the query to be run
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department  
    FROM Northwind.vEmployeeDepartment
    WHERE FirstName = @FirstName AND LastName = @LastName  
    AND EndDate IS NULL;  

Calling the procedure:

    EXECUTE Northwind.getEmployee N'Ackerman', N'Pilar';
    
    -- Or  
    EXEC Northwind.getEmployee @LastName = N'Ackerman', @FirstName = N'Pilar';  
    GO  
    
    -- Or  
    EXECUTE Northwind.getEmployee @FirstName = N'Pilar', @LastName = N'Ackerman';  
    GO
