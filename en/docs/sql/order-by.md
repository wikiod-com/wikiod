## Use ORDER BY with TOP to return the top x rows based on a column's value
In this example, we can use GROUP BY not only determined the *sort* of the rows returned, but also what rows *are* returned, since we're using TOP to limit the result set.

Let's say we want to return the top 5 highest reputation users from an unnamed popular Q&A site.

**Without ORDER BY**

This query returns the Top 5 rows ordered by the default, which in this case is "Id", the first column in the table (even though it's not a column shown in the results).

    SELECT TOP 5 DisplayName, Reputation
    FROM Users

returns...

| DisplayName | Reputation |
| ------ | ------ |
| Community   | 1   |
| Geoff Dalgas   | 12567   |
| Jarrod Dixon   | 11739   |
| Jeff Atwood   | 37628   |
| Joel Spolsky   | 25784   |

**With ORDER BY**

    SELECT TOP 5 DisplayName, Reputation
    FROM Users
    ORDER BY Reputation desc

returns...

| DisplayName | Reputation |
| ------ | ------ |
| JonSkeet       | **865023**   |
| Darin Dimitrov | **661741**   |
| BalusC         | **650237**   |
| Hans Passant   | **625870**   |
| Marc Gravell   | **601636**   |

**Remarks**

Some versions of SQL (such as MySQL) use a `LIMIT` clause at the end of a `SELECT`, instead of `TOP` at the beginning, for example:

    SELECT DisplayName, Reputation
    FROM Users
    ORDER BY Reputation DESC
    LIMIT 5

## Sorting by column number (instead of name)
<!-- language: lang-sql -->

You can use a column's number (where the leftmost column is '1') to indicate which column to base the sort on, instead of describing the column by its name.

**Pro:** If you think it's likely you might change column names later, doing so won't break this code.

**Con:** This will generally reduce readability of the query (It's instantly clear what 'ORDER BY Reputation' means, while 'ORDER BY 14' requires some counting, probably with a finger on the screen.)

This query sorts result by the info in relative column position `3` from select statement instead of column name `Reputation`. 
```sql
SELECT DisplayName, JoinDate, Reputation
FROM Users
ORDER BY 3
```

| DisplayName | JoinDate | Reputation |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Community     | 2008-09-15 | **1**     |
| Jarrod Dixon  | 2008-10-03 | **11739** |
| Geoff Dalgas  | 2008-10-03 | **12567** |
| Joel Spolsky  | 2008-09-16 | **25784** |
| Jeff Atwood   | 2008-09-16 | **37628** |


## Sorting by multiple columns
<!-- language: lang-sql -->
```sql
SELECT DisplayName, JoinDate, Reputation
FROM Users
ORDER BY JoinDate, Reputation
```

| DisplayName | JoinDate | Reputation |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Community      | **2008-09-15** | **1**     |
| Jeff Atwood    | **2008-09-16** | **25784** |
| Joel Spolsky   |   2008-09-16   | **37628** |
| Jarrod Dixon   | **2008-10-03** | **11739** |
| Geoff Dalgas   |   2008-10-03   | **12567** |



## Order by Alias
Due to logical query processing order, alias can be used in order by.

    SELECT DisplayName, JoinDate as jd, Reputation as rep
    FROM Users
    ORDER BY jd, rep

And can use relative order of the columns in the select statement .Consider the same example as above and instead of using alias use the relative order like for display name it is 1 , for Jd it is 2 and so on

    SELECT DisplayName, JoinDate as jd, Reputation as rep
    FROM Users
    ORDER BY 2, 3

## Customizeed sorting order
To sort this table `Employee` by department, you would use `ORDER BY Department`.
However, if you want a different sort order that is not alphabetical, you have to map the `Department` values into different values that sort correctly; this can be done with a CASE expression:

| Name    | Department |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Hasan   | IT         |
| Yusuf   | HR         |
| Hillary | HR         |
| Joe     | IT         |
| Merry   | HR         |
| Ken     | Accountant |

    SELECT *
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY CASE Department
             WHEN 'HR'         THEN 1
             WHEN 'Accountant' THEN 2
             ELSE                   3
             END;

| Name    | Department     |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Yusuf   | **HR**         |
| Hillary | **HR**         |
| Merry   | **HR**         |
| Ken     | **Accountant** |
| Hasan   | **IT**         |
| Joe     | **IT**         |
