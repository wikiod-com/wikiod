`NULL` in SQL, as well as programming in general, means literally "nothing". In SQL, it is easier to understand as "the absence of any value". 

It is important to distinguish it from seemingly empty values, such as the empty string `''` or the number `0`, neither of which are actually `NULL`. 

It is also important to be careful not to enclose `NULL` in quotes, like `'NULL'`, which is allowed in columns that accept text, but is not `NULL` and can cause errors and incorrect data sets.

## Filtering for NULL in queries
The syntax for filtering for `NULL` (i.e. the absence of a value) in `WHERE` blocks is slightly different than filtering for specific values. 

    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE ManagerId IS NULL ;
    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE ManagerId IS NOT NULL ;

Note that because `NULL` is not equal to anything, not even to itself, using equality operators `= NULL` or `<> NULL` (or `!= NULL`) will always yield the truth value of `UNKNOWN` which will be rejected by `WHERE`.

`WHERE` filters all rows that the condition is `FALSE` or `UKNOWN` and keeps only rows that the condition is `TRUE`.

## Nullable columns in tables
When creating tables it is possible to declare a column as nullable or non-nullable.

    CREATE TABLE MyTable
    (
        MyCol1 INT NOT NULL, -- non-nullable
        MyCol2 INT NULL      -- nullable
    ) ;

By default every column (except those in primary key constraint) is nullable unless we explicitly set `NOT NULL` constraint.

Attempting to assign `NULL` to a non-nullable column will result in an error.

    INSERT INTO MyTable (MyCol1, MyCol2) VALUES (1, NULL) ;  -- works fine

    INSERT INTO MyTable (MyCol1, MyCol2) VALUES (NULL, 2) ;  
            -- cannot insert
            -- the value NULL into column 'MyCol1', table 'MyTable'; 
            -- column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails.

## Updating fields to NULL
Setting a field to `NULL` works exactly like with any other value:

    UPDATE Employees 
    SET ManagerId = NULL
    WHERE Id = 4

## Inserting rows with NULL fields
For example inserting an employee with no phone number and no manager into the [Employees](https://www.wikiod.com/sql/example-databases-and-tables#Auto Shop Database) example table:

    INSERT INTO Employees
        (Id, FName, LName, PhoneNumber, ManagerId, DepartmentId, Salary, HireDate)
    VALUES
        (5, 'Jane', 'Doe', NULL, NULL, 2, 800, '2016-07-22') ;
