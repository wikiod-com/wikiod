## Setting up a flag if other rows have a common property
Let's say I have this data:

Table items

| id | name | tag |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | example   |  unique_tag      |
| 2   | foo |  simple      |
| 42   | bar |  simple      |
| 3   | baz |  hello      |
| 51   | quux   |  world      |

I'd like to get all those lines and know if a tag is used by other lines

    SELECT id, name, tag, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY tag) > 1 AS flag FROM items

The result will be:

| id | name | tag | flag |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- |
| 1   | example   |  unique_tag      | false |
| 2   | foo |  simple      | true |
| 42   | bar |  simple      | true |
| 3   | baz |  hello      | false |
| 51   | quux   |  world      | false |

In case your database doesn't have OVER and PARTITION you can use this to produce the same result:

    SELECT id, name, tag, (SELECT COUNT(tag) FROM items B WHERE tag = A.tag) > 1 AS flag FROM items A


## Getting a running total
Given this data:

| date| amount |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2016-03-12 | 200   |
| 2016-03-11 | -50   |
| 2016-03-14 | 100   |
| 2016-03-15 | 100   |
| 2016-03-10 | -250   |

    SELECT date, amount, SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date ASC) AS running
    FROM operations
    ORDER BY date ASC

will give you


| date| amount | running
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 2016-03-10 | -250   | -250 |
| 2016-03-11 | -50   | -300 |
| 2016-03-12 | 200   | -100 |
| 2016-03-14 | 100   | 0 |
| 2016-03-15 | 100   | -100 |


## Finding "out-of-sequence" records using the LAG() function
Given these sample data:

|ID         |STATUS    |STATUS_TIME               |STATUS_BY |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------|----------|
|          1|ONE       |2016-09-28-19.47.52.501398|USER_1    |
|          3|ONE       |2016-09-28-19.47.52.501511|USER_2    |
|          1|THREE     |2016-09-28-19.47.52.501517|USER_3    |
|          3|TWO       |2016-09-28-19.47.52.501521|USER_2    |
|          3|THREE     |2016-09-28-19.47.52.501524|USER_4    |

Items identified by `ID` values must move from `STATUS` 'ONE' to 'TWO' to 'THREE' in sequence, without skipping statuses. The problem is to find users (`STATUS_BY`) values who violate the rule and move from 'ONE' immediately to 'THREE'.

The `LAG()` analytical function helps to solve the problem by returning for each row the value in the preceding row:

    SELECT * FROM (
     SELECT 
      t.*, 
      LAG(status) OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY status_time) AS prev_status 
      FROM test t
    ) t1 WHERE status = 'THREE' AND prev_status != 'TWO'

In case your database doesn't have LAG() you can use this to produce the same result:

    SELECT A.id, A.status, B.status as prev_status, A.status_time, B.status_time as prev_status_time
    FROM Data A, Data B
    WHERE A.id = B.id
    AND   B.status_time = (SELECT MAX(status_time) FROM Data where status_time < A.status_time and id = A.id)
    AND   A.status = 'THREE' AND NOT B.status = 'TWO'

## Adding the total rows selected to every row
    SELECT your_columns, COUNT(*) OVER() as Ttl_Rows FROM your_data_set

| id | name | Ttl_Rows |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | example   |  5      |
| 2   | foo |  5|
| 3 | bar |  5|
| 4 | baz |  5|
| 5 | quux   |  5      |

Instead of using two queries to get a count then the line, you can use an aggregate as a window function and use the full result set as the window.  
This can be used as a base for further calculation without the complexity of extra self joins.

## Getting the N most recent rows over multiple grouping
Given this data

| User_ID | Completion_Date |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1   | 2016-07-20  |
| 1   | 2016-07-21  |
| 2   | 2016-07-20  |
| 2   | 2016-07-21  |
| 2   | 2016-07-22  |

    ;with CTE as
    (SELECT *, 
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY User_ID 
                               ORDER BY Completion_Date DESC) Row_Num
    FROM    Data)
    SELECT * FORM CTE WHERE Row_Num <= n

Using n=1, you'll get the one most recent row per `user_id`:

| User_ID | Completion_Date |Row_Num |
| ------ | ------ |------ |
| 1   | 2016-07-21  |1
| 2   | 2016-07-22  |1
