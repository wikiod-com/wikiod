How to write good, readable SQL queries, and example of good practices.

## Formatting and Spelling of Keywords and Names
# Table/Column Names

Two common ways of formatting table/column names are [`CamelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) and [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case):

    SELECT FirstName, LastName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 500;

<!-- -->

    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 500;

Names should describe what is stored in their object. This implies that column names usually should be singular.
Whether table names should use singular or plural is a [heavily discussed](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/338156/table-naming-dilemma-singular-vs-plural-names) question, but in practice, it is more common to use plural table names.

Adding prefixes or suffixes like `tbl` or `col` reduces readability, so avoid them.
However, they are sometimes used to avoid conflicts with SQL keywords, and often used with triggers and indexes (whose names are usually not mentioned in queries).

# Keywords

SQL keywords are not case sensitive.
However, it is common practice to write them in upper case.

## Indenting
There is no widely accepted standard. What everyone agrees on is that squeezing everything into a single line is bad:

    SELECT d.Name, COUNT(*) AS Employees FROM Departments AS d JOIN Employees AS e ON d.ID = e.DepartmentID WHERE d.Name != 'HR' HAVING COUNT(*) > 10 ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

At the minimum, put every clause into a new line, and split lines if they would become too long otherwise:

    SELECT d.Name,
           COUNT(*) AS Employees
    FROM Departments AS d
    JOIN Employees AS e ON d.ID = e.DepartmentID
    WHERE d.Name != 'HR'
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 10
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

Sometimes, everything after the SQL keyword introducing a clause is indented to the same column:

    SELECT   d.Name,
             COUNT(*) AS Employees
    FROM     Departments AS d
    JOIN     Employees AS e ON d.ID = e.DepartmentID
    WHERE    d.Name != 'HR'
    HAVING   COUNT(*) > 10
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

(This can also be done while aligning the SQL keywords right.)

Another common style is to put important keywords on their own lines:

    SELECT
        d.Name,
        COUNT(*) AS Employees
    FROM
        Departments AS d
    JOIN
        Employees AS e
        ON d.ID = e.DepartmentID
    WHERE
        d.Name != 'HR'
    HAVING
        COUNT(*) > 10
    ORDER BY
        COUNT(*) DESC;

---

Vertically aligning multiple similar expressions improves readability:

    SELECT Model,
           EmployeeID
    FROM Cars
    WHERE CustomerID = 42
      AND Status     = 'READY';

---

Using multiple lines makes it harder to embed SQL commands into other programming languages.
However, many languages have a mechanism for multi-line strings, e.g., `@"..."` in C#, `"""..."""` in Python, or `R"(...)"` in C++.

## SELECT *
`SELECT *` returns all columns in the same order as they are defined in the table.

When using `SELECT *`, the data returned by a query can change whenever the table definition changes. This increases the risk that different versions of your application or your database are incompatible with each other.

Furthermore, reading more columns than necessary can increase the amount of disk and network I/O.

So you should always explicitly specify the column(s) you actually want to retrieve:

    --SELECT *                                 don't
      SELECT ID, FName, LName, PhoneNumber  -- do
      FROM Emplopees;

(When doing interactive queries, these considerations do not apply.)

However, `SELECT *` does not hurt in the subquery of an EXISTS operator, because EXISTS ignores the actual data anyway (it checks only if at least one row has been found). For the same reason, it is not meaningful to list any specific column(s) for EXISTS, so `SELECT *` actually makes more sense:

    -- list departments where nobody was hired recently
    SELECT ID,
           Name
    FROM Departments
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                      FROM Employees
                      WHERE DepartmentID = Departments.ID
                        AND HireDate >= '2015-01-01');

## Joins
Explicit joins should always be used; [implicit joins](https://www.wikiod.com/sql/join#Implicit Join) have several problems:

  - The join condition is somewhere in the WHERE clause, mixed up with any other filter conditions. This makes it harder to see which tables are joined, and how.

  - Due to the above, there is a higher risk of mistakes, and it is more likely that they are found later.

  - In standard SQL, explicit joins are the only way to use [outer joins](https://www.wikiod.com/sql/join#Differences between inner/outer joins):

        SELECT d.Name,
               e.Fname || e.LName AS EmpName
        FROM      Departments AS d
        LEFT JOIN Employees   AS e ON d.ID = e.DepartmentID;

  - Explicit joins allow using the USING clause:

        SELECT RecipeID,
               Recipes.Name,
               COUNT(*) AS NumberOfIngredients
        FROM      Recipes
        LEFT JOIN Ingredients USING (RecipeID);

    (This requires that both tables use the same column name.  
    USING automatically removes the duplicate column from the result, e.g., the join in this query returns a single `RecipeID` column.)
