## CREATE TRIGGER
This example creates a trigger that inserts a record to a second table (MyAudit) after a record is inserted into the table the trigger is defined on (MyTable). Here the "inserted" table is a special table used by Microsoft SQL Server to store affected rows during INSERT and UPDATE statements; there is also a special "deleted" table that performs the same function for DELETE statements.
 
    CREATE TRIGGER MyTrigger
        ON MyTable
        AFTER INSERT
    
    AS
    
    BEGIN
        -- insert audit record to MyAudit table
        INSERT INTO MyAudit(MyTableId, User)
        (SELECT MyTableId, CURRENT_USER FROM inserted)
    END

## Use Trigger to manage a "Recycle Bin" for deleted items
    CREATE TRIGGER BooksDeleteTrigger
        ON MyBooksDB.Books
        AFTER DELETE
    AS
      INSERT INTO BooksRecycleBin
        SELECT *
        FROM deleted;
    GO
