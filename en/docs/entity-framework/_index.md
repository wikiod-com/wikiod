Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.

Entity Framework allows you to create a model by writing code or using boxes and lines in the EF Designer. Both of these approaches can be used to target an existing database or create a new database.

Entity Framework is the main ORM that Microsoft provides for the .NET Framework and Microsoftâ€™s recommended data access technology.
