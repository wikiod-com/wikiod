## Database.BeginTransaction()
Multiple operations can be executed against a single transaction so that changes can be rolled back if any of the operations fail.

    using (var context = new PlanetContext())
    {
        using (var transaction = context.Database.BeginTransaction())
        {
            try
            {
                //Lets assume this works
                var jupiter = new Planet { Name = "Jupiter" };
                context.Planets.Add(jupiter);
                context.SaveChanges();

                //And then this will throw an exception
                var neptune = new Planet { Name = "Neptune" };
                context.Planets.Add(neptune);
                context.SaveChanges();

                //Without this line, no changes will get applied to the database
                transaction.Commit();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                //There is no need to call transaction.Rollback() here as the transaction object
                //will go out of scope and disposing will roll back automatically
            }
        }
    }

Note that it may be a developers' convention to call `transaction.Rollback()` explicitly, because it makes the code more self-explanatory. Also, there *may* be (less well-known) query providers for Entity Framework out there that don't implement `Dipsose` correctly, which would also require an explicit `transaction.Rollback()` call.
