In this topic I will overview spring boot package scanning.

You can find some basic information in spring boot docs in the following link ([using-boot-structuring-your-code](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-structuring-your-code.html)) but I will try to provide more detailed information.

Spring boot, and spring in general, provide a feature to automatically scan packages for certain annotations in order to create `beans` and `configuration`.

## Parameters
| Annotation | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| @SpringBootApplication | Main spring boot application annotation. used one time in the application, contains a main method, and act as main package for package scanning |
| @SpringBootConfiguration | Indicates that a class provides Spring Boot application. Should be declared only once in the application, usually automatically by setting `@SpringBootApplication` |
| @EnableAutoConfiguration | Enable auto-configuration of the Spring Application Context. Should be declared only once in the application, usually automatically by setting `@SpringBootApplication` |
| @ComponentScan | Used to trigger automatic package scanning on a certain package and its children or to set custom package scanning |
| @Configuration | Used to declare one or more `@Bean` methods. Can be picked by auto package scanning in order to declare one or more `@Bean` methods instead of traditional xml configuration |
| @Bean | Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. Usually `@Bean` annotated methods will be placed in `@Configuration` annotated classes that will be picked by package scanning to create java configuration based beans. |
| @Component | By declaring a class as a `@Component` it becomes a candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning. Usually a class annotated with `@Component` will become a `bean` in the application |
| @Repository | Originally defined by Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as "a mechanism for encapsulating storage. It is usualy used to indicate a `Repository` for `spring data` |
| @Service | Very similar in practice to `@Component`. originally defined by Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as "an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, with no encapsulated state." |
| @Controller | Indicates that an annotated class is a "Controller" (e.g. a web controller). |
| @RestController | A convenience annotation that is itself annotated with `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. Will be automatically picked by default because it contains the `@Controller` annotation that is picked by default. |

## @ComponentScan
You can use `@ComponentScan` in order to configure more complex package scanning. There is also `@ComponentScans` that act as a container annotation that aggregates several `@ComponentScan` annotations.

**Basic code examples**

    @ComponentScan
    public class DemoAutoConfiguration {
    }
***
    @ComponentScans({@ComponentScan("com.example1"), @ComponentScan("com.example2")})
    public class DemoAutoConfiguration {
    }

***

Stating `@ComponentScan` with no configuration acts like `@SpringBootApplication` and scans all packages under the class annotated with this annotation.

In this example I will state some of the useful attributes of `@ComponentScan`:

 1. **basePackages** - can be used to state specific packages to scan.
 2. **useDefaultFilters** - by setting this attribute to false (defaults true) you can make sure spring does not scan `@Component`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, or `@Controller` automatically.
 3. **includeFilters** - can be used to *include* specific spring annotations / regex patterns to include in package scanning.
 4. **excludeFilters** - can be used to *exclude* specific spring annotations / regex patterns to include in package scanning.

There are many more attributes but those are the most commonly used in order to customize package scanning.

## Creating your own auto-configuration
Spring boot is based on a lot of pre-made auto-configuration parent projects. You should already be familiar with spring boot starter projects.

You can easily create your own starter project by doing the following easy steps:

 1. Create some `@Configuration` classes to define default beans. You should use external properties as much as possible to allow customization and try to use auto-configuration helper annotations like `@AutoConfigureBefore`, `@AutoConfigureAfter`, `@ConditionalOnBean`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` etc. You can find more detailed information on each annotation in the official documentation [Condition annotations](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-developing-auto-configuration.html#boot-features-condition-annotations)
 2. Place an auto-configuration file/files that aggregates all of the `@Configuration` classes.
 3. Create a file named `spring.factories` and place it in `src/main/resources/META-INF`.
 4. In `spring.factories`, set `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration` property with comma separated values of your `@Configuration` classes:


    org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=\
    com.mycorp.libx.autoconfigure.LibXAutoConfiguration,\
    com.mycorp.libx.autoconfigure.LibXWebAutoConfiguration
Using this method you can create your own auto-configuration classes that will be picked by spring-boot. Spring-boot automatically scan all maven/gradle dependencies for a `spring.factories` file, if it finds one, it adds all `@Configuration` classes specified in it to its auto-configuration process.

Make sure your `auto-configuration` starter project does not contain `spring boot maven plugin` because it will package the project as an executable JAR and won't be loaded by the classpath as intended - spring boot will not be able to find your `spring.factories` and won't load your configuration

## @SpringBootApplication
The most basic way to structure your code using spring boot for good automatic package scanning is using `@SpringBootApplication` annotation. This annotation provide in itself 3 other annotations that helps with automatic scanning: `@SpringBootConfiguration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, `@ComponentScan` (more info about each annotation in the `Parameters` section).

`@SpringBootApplication` will usualy be placed in the main package and all other components will be placed in packages under this file:

    com
     +- example
         +- myproject
             +- Application.java (annotated with @SpringBootApplication)
             |
             +- domain
             |   +- Customer.java
             |   +- CustomerRepository.java
             |
             +- service
             |   +- CustomerService.java
             |
             +- web
                 +- CustomerController.java

Unless mentioned otherwise, spring boot detects `@Configuration`, `@Component`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, `@Controller`, `@RestController` annotations automatically under the scanned packages (`@Configuration` and `@RestController` are being picked because they are annotated by `@Component` and `@Controller` accordingly).

**Basic Code example:**

    @SpringBootApplication
    public class Application {
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
        }
        
    }

**Setting packages/classes explicitly**

Since version **1.3** you can also tell spring boot to scan specific packages by setting `scanBasePackages` or `scanBasePackageClasses` in `@SpringBootApplication` instead of specifying `@ComponentScan`.

 1. `@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = "com.example.myproject")` - set `com.example.myproject` as the base package to scan.
 2. `@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackageClasses = CustomerController.class)` - type-safe alternative to `scanBasePackages` sets the package of `CustomerController.java`, `com.example.myproject.web`, as the base package to scan.

**Excluding auto-configuration**

Another important feature is the ability to exclude specific auto-configuration classes using `exclude` or `excludeName` (`excludeName` exist since version **1.3**).

 1. `@SpringBootApplication(exclude = DemoConfiguration.class)` - will exclude `DemoConfiguration` from auto package scanning.
 2. `@SpringBootApplication(excludeName = "DemoConfiguration")` - will do the same using class fully classified name.
