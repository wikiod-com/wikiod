Unlike the .NET framework, the Visual Basic for Applications library does not include routines to sort arrays.

There are two types of workarounds: 1) implementing a sorting algorithm from scratch, or 2) using sorting routines in other commonly-available libraries.

## Algorithm Implementation - Quick Sort on a One-Dimensional Array
From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152319/vba-array-sort-function


    Public Sub QuickSort(vArray As Variant, inLow As Long, inHi As Long)
    
      Dim pivot   As Variant
      Dim tmpSwap As Variant
      Dim tmpLow  As Long
      Dim tmpHi   As Long
    
      tmpLow = inLow
      tmpHi = inHi
    
      pivot = vArray((inLow + inHi) \ 2)
    
      While (tmpLow <= tmpHi)
    
         While (vArray(tmpLow) < pivot And tmpLow < inHi)
            tmpLow = tmpLow + 1
         Wend
    
         While (pivot < vArray(tmpHi) And tmpHi > inLow)
            tmpHi = tmpHi - 1
         Wend
    
         If (tmpLow <= tmpHi) Then
            tmpSwap = vArray(tmpLow)
            vArray(tmpLow) = vArray(tmpHi)
            vArray(tmpHi) = tmpSwap
            tmpLow = tmpLow + 1
            tmpHi = tmpHi - 1
         End If
    
      Wend
    
      If (inLow < tmpHi) Then QuickSort vArray, inLow, tmpHi
      If (tmpLow < inHi) Then QuickSort vArray, tmpLow, inHi
    
    End Sub

## Using the Excel Library to Sort a One-Dimensional Array
This code takes advantage of the `Sort` class in the Microsoft Excel Object Library.
