VBA has built-in functions for extracting specific parts of strings, including:

- `Left`/`Left$`
- `Right`/`Right$`
- `Mid`/`Mid$`
- `Trim`/`Trim$`

To avoid implicit type conversion onverhead (and therefore for better performance), use the $-suffixed version of the function when a string variable is passed to the function, and/or if the result of the function is assigned to a string variable.

Passing a `Null` parameter value to a $-suffixed function will raise a runtime error ("invalid use of null") - this is especially relevant for code involving a database.

## Use Left or Left$ to get the 3 left-most characters in a string
    Const baseString As String = "Foo Bar"
  
    Dim leftText As String
    leftText = Left$(baseString, 3)
    'leftText = "Foo"


## Use Right or Right$ to get the 3 right-most characters in a string
    Const baseString As String = "Foo Bar"
    Dim rightText As String
    rightText = Right$(baseString, 3)
    'rightText = "Bar"


## Use Mid or Mid$ to get specific characters from within a string
    Const baseString As String = "Foo Bar"
    
    'Get the string starting at character 2 and ending at character 6
    Dim midText As String
    midText = Mid$(baseString, 2, 5)
    'midText = "oo Ba"


## Use Trim to get a copy of the string without any leading or trailing spaces
    'Trim the leading and trailing spaces in a string
    Const paddedText As String = "    Foo Bar    "
    Dim trimmedText As String
    trimmedText = Trim$(paddedText)
    'trimmedText = "Foo Bar"
