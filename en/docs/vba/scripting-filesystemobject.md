## Retrieve only the path from a file path
The GetParentFolderName method returns the parent folder for any path.  While this can also be used with folders, it is arguably more useful for extracting the path from an absolute file path:

    Dim fso As New Scripting.FileSystemObject
    Debug.Print fso.GetParentFolderName("C:\Users\Me\My Documents\SomeFile.txt")

Prints `C:\Users\Me\My Documents` 

Note that the trailing path separator is not included in the returned string.

## Retrieve just the extension from a file name
    Dim fso As New Scripting.FileSystemObject
    Debug.Print fso.GetExtensionName("MyFile.something.txt")

Prints `txt`
Note that the `GetExtensionName()` method already handles multiple periods in a file name.

## Recursively enumerate folders and files
Early Bound (with a reference to `Microsoft Scripting Runtime`)

    Sub EnumerateFilesAndFolders( _
        FolderPath As String, _
        Optional MaxDepth As Long = -1, _
        Optional CurrentDepth As Long = 0, _
        Optional Indentation As Long = 2)
      
        Dim FSO As Scripting.FileSystemObject
        Set FSO = New Scripting.FileSystemObject
        
        'Check the folder exists
        If FSO.FolderExists(FolderPath) Then
            Dim fldr As Scripting.Folder
            Set fldr = FSO.GetFolder(FolderPath)
            
            'Output the starting directory path
            If CurrentDepth = 0 Then
              Debug.Print fldr.Path
            End If
            
            'Enumerate the subfolders
            Dim subFldr As Scripting.Folder
            For Each subFldr In fldr.SubFolders
                Debug.Print Space$((CurrentDepth + 1) * Indentation) & subFldr.Name
                If CurrentDepth < MaxDepth Or MaxDepth = -1 Then
                    'Recursively call EnumerateFilesAndFolders
                    EnumerateFilesAndFolders subFldr.Path, MaxDepth, CurrentDepth + 1, Indentation
                End If
            Next subFldr
            
            'Enumerate the files
            Dim fil As Scripting.File
            For Each fil In fldr.Files
                Debug.Print Space$((CurrentDepth + 1) * Indentation) & fil.Name
            Next fil
        End If
    End Sub

## Strip file extension from a file name
    Dim fso As New Scripting.FileSystemObject
    Debug.Print fso.GetBaseName("MyFile.something.txt")

Prints `MyFile.something`

Note that the `GetBaseName()` method already handles multiple periods in a file name.

## Creating a FileSystemObject
    Const ForReading = 1
    Const ForWriting = 2
    Const ForAppending = 8
    
    Sub FsoExample()
        Dim fso As Object ' declare variable
        Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject") ' Set it to be a File System Object
    
        ' now use it to check if a file exists
        Dim myFilePath As String
        myFilePath = "C:\mypath\to\myfile.txt"
        If fso.FileExists(myFilePath) Then
            ' do something
        Else
            ' file doesn't exist
            MsgBox "File doesn't exist"
        End If
    End Sub

## Reading a text file using a FileSystemObject
    Const ForReading = 1
    Const ForWriting = 2
    Const ForAppending = 8
    
    Sub ReadTextFileExample()
        Dim fso As Object
        Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
        Dim sourceFile As Object
        Dim myFilePath As String
        Dim myFileText As String
    
        myFilePath = "C:\mypath\to\myfile.txt"
        Set sourceFile = fso.OpenTextFile(myFilePath, ForReading)
        myFileText = sourceFile.ReadAll ' myFileText now contains the content of the text file
        sourceFile.Close ' close the file
        ' do whatever you might need to do with the text
    
        ' You can also read it line by line
        Dim line As String
        Set sourceFile = fso.OpenTextFile(myFilePath, ForReading)
        While Not sourceFile.AtEndOfStream ' while we are not finished reading through the file
            line = sourceFile.ReadLine
            ' do something with the line...
        Wend
        sourceFile.Close
    End Sub

## Creating a text file with FileSystemObject
    Sub CreateTextFileExample()
        Dim fso As Object
        Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
        Dim targetFile As Object
        Dim myFilePath As String
        Dim myFileText As String

        myFilePath = "C:\mypath\to\myfile.txt"
        Set targetFile = fso.CreateTextFile(myFilePath, True)  ' this will overwrite any existing file
        targetFile.Write "This is some new text"
        targetFile.Write " And this text will appear right after the first bit of text."
        targetFile.WriteLine "This bit of text includes a newline character to ensure each write takes its own line."
        targetFile.Close ' close the file
    End Sub

## Enumerate files in a directory using FileSystemObject
Early bound (requires a reference to Microsoft Scripting Runtime):

    Public Sub EnumerateDirectory()
        Dim fso As Scripting.FileSystemObject
        Set fso = New Scripting.FileSystemObject
    
        Dim targetFolder As Folder
        Set targetFolder = fso.GetFolder("C:\")
        
        Dim foundFile As Variant
        For Each foundFile In targetFolder.Files
            Debug.Print foundFile.Name
        Next
    End Sub

Late bound:

    Public Sub EnumerateDirectory()
        Dim fso As Object
        Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
        Dim targetFolder As Object
        Set targetFolder = fso.GetFolder("C:\")
        
        Dim foundFile As Variant
        For Each foundFile In targetFolder.Files
            Debug.Print foundFile.Name
        Next
    End Sub

## Writing to an existing file with FileSystemObject
    
    Const ForReading = 1
    Const ForWriting = 2
    Const ForAppending = 8


    Sub WriteTextFileExample()
        Dim oFso
        Set oFso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
        Dim oFile as Object
        Dim myFilePath as String
        Dim myFileText as String

        myFilePath = "C:\mypath\to\myfile.txt"
        ' First check if the file exists
        If oFso.FileExists(myFilePath) Then
            ' this will overwrite any existing filecontent with whatever you send the file
            ' to append data to the end of an existing file, use ForAppending instead
            Set oFile = oFso.OpenTextFile(myFilePath, ForWriting)  
        Else
            ' create the file instead
            Set oFile = oFso.CreateTextFile(myFilePath) ' skipping the optional boolean for overwrite if exists as we already checked that the file doesn't exist.
        End If
        oFile.Write "This is some new text"
        oFile.Write " And this text will appear right after the first bit of text."
        oFile.WriteLine "This bit of text includes a newline character to ensure each write takes its own line."
        oFile.Close ' close the file
    End Sub

## Using FSO.BuildPath to build a Full Path from folder path and file name
If you're accepting user input for folder paths, you might need to check for trailing backslashes (`\`) before building a file path. The `FSO.BuildPath` method makes this simpler:

      Const sourceFilePath As String = "C:\Temp"  '<-- Without trailing backslash
      Const targetFilePath As String = "C:\Temp\" '<-- With trailing backslash
    
      Const fileName As String = "Results.txt"
      
      Dim FSO As FileSystemObject
      Set FSO = New FileSystemObject
      
      Debug.Print FSO.BuildPath(sourceFilePath, fileName)
      Debug.Print FSO.BuildPath(targetFilePath, fileName)

Output:

    C:\Temp\Results.txt
    C:\Temp\Results.txt
