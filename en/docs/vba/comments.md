**Comment Blocks**

If you need to comment or uncomment several lines at once, you can use the IDE's **Edit Toolbar** buttons:

>**Comment Block** - Adds a single apostrophe to the start of all selected lines

[![Comment Block][1]][1]

>**Uncomment Block** - Removes the first apostrophe from the start of all selected lines

[![Uncomment Block][2]][2]

**Multi-line Comments**
Many other languages support multi-line block comments, but VBA only allows single-line comments.

## Apostrophe Comments
A comment is marked by an apostrophe (`'`), and ignored when the code executes. Comments help explain your code to future readers, including yourself.

Since all lines starting with a comment are ignored, they can also be used to prevent code from executing (while you debug or refactor). Placing an apostrophe `'` before your code turns it into a comment.  (This is called *commenting out* the line.)

    Sub InlineDocumentation()
      'Comments start with an "'"
    
      'They can be place before a line of code, which prevents the line from executing
      'Debug.Print "Hello World"
    
      'They can also be placed after a statement
      'The statement still executes, until the compiler arrives at the comment
      Debug.Print "Hello World"  'Prints a welcome message

    'Comments can have 0 indention....
         '... or as much as needed

      '''' Comments can contain multiple apostrophes ''''

      'Comments can span lines (using line continuations) _
        but this can make for hard to read code

      'If you need to have mult-line comments, it is often easier to 
      'use an apostrophe on each line

      'The continued statement syntax (:) is treated as part of the comment, so 
      'it is not possible to place an executable statement after a comment
      'This won't run : Debug.Print "Hello World"
    End Sub
    
    'Comments can appear inside or outside a procedure


## REM Comments
    Sub RemComments()
      Rem Comments start with "Rem" (VBA will change any alternate casing to "Rem")
      Rem is an abbreviation of Remark, and similar to DOS syntax
      Rem Is a legacy approach to adding comments, and apostrophes should be preferred

      Rem Comments CANNOT appear after a statement, use the apostrophe syntax instead
      Rem Unless they are preceded by the instruction separator token
      Debug.Print "Hello World": Rem prints a welcome message
      Debug.Print "Hello World" 'Prints a welcome message

      'Rem cannot be immediately followed by the following characters "!,@,#,$,%,&"
      'Whereas the apostrophe syntax can be followed by any printable character.

    End Sub

    Rem Comments can appear inside or outside a procedure
