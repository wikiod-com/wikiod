[TODO: This topic should be an example of all the basic CS 101 data structures along with some explanation as an overview of how data structures can be implemented in VBA. This would be a good opportunity to tie in and reinforce concepts introduced in Class-related topics in VBA documentation.]

## Linked List
This linked list example implements [Set abstract data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) operations.

**SinglyLinkedNode** class

    Option Explicit
    
    Private Value As Variant
    Private NextNode As SinglyLinkedNode '"Next" is a keyword in VBA and therefore is not a valid variable name

**LinkedList** class

    Option Explicit
    
    Private head As SinglyLinkedNode
    
    'Set type operations
    
    Public Sub Add(value As Variant)
        Dim node As SinglyLinkedNode
            
        Set node = New SinglyLinkedNode
        node.value = value
        Set node.nextNode = head
        
        Set head = node
    End Sub
    
    Public Sub Remove(value As Variant)
        Dim node As SinglyLinkedNode
        Dim prev As SinglyLinkedNode
        
        Set node = head
        
        While Not node Is Nothing
            If node.value = value Then
                'remove node
                If node Is head Then
                    Set head = node.nextNode
                Else
                    Set prev.nextNode = node.nextNode
                End If
                Exit Sub
            End If
            Set prev = node
            Set node = node.nextNode
        Wend
    
    End Sub
    
    Public Function Exists(value As Variant) As Boolean
        Dim node As SinglyLinkedNode
        
        Set node = head
        While Not node Is Nothing
            If node.value = value Then
                Exists = True
                Exit Function
            End If
            Set node = node.nextNode
        Wend
    End Function
    
    Public Function Count() As Long
        Dim node As SinglyLinkedNode
        
        Set node = head
        
        While Not node Is Nothing
            Count = Count + 1
            Set node = node.nextNode
        Wend
        
    End Function




## Binary Tree
This is an example of an unbalanced [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). A binary tree is structured conceptually as a hierarchy of nodes descending downward from a common root, where each node has two children: left and right. For example, suppose the numbers 7, 5, 9, 3, 11, 6, 12, 14 and 15 were inserted into a BinaryTree. The structure would be as below. Note that this binary tree is not [balanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree), which can be a desirable characteristic for guaranteeing the performance of lookups - see [AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) for an example of a self-balancing binary search tree.

                / \
               5   9
              / \   \
             3   6   11
                       \ 
                        12
                          \
                           14
                            \
                             15


**BinaryTreeNode** class

    Option Explicit
    
    Public left As BinaryTreeNode
    Public right As BinaryTreeNode
    Public key As Variant
    Public value As Variant

**BinaryTree** class
