API stands for [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)

API's for VBA imply a set of methods that allow direct interaction with the operating system

System calls can be made by executing procedures defined in DLL files

Common operating environment library files (DLL's):

| Dynamic Link Library| Description|
| ------ | ------ |
| Advapi32.dll | Advanced services library for APIs including many security and Registry calls
| Comdlg32.dll | Common dialog API library |
| Gdi32.dll | Graphics Device Interface API library |
| Kernel32.dll | Core Windows 32-bit base API support |
| Lz32.dll | 32-bit compression routines |
| Mpr.dll | Multiple Provider Router library |
| Netapi32.dll | 32-bit Network API library |
| Shell32.dll | 32-bit Shell API library |
| User32.dll | Library for user interface routines |
| Version.dll | Version library |
| Winmm.dll | Windows multimedia library |
| Winspool.drv | Print spooler interface that contains the print spooler API calls |



New arguments used for the 64 system:

| Type | Item | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Qualifier | PtrSafe | Indicates that the Declare statement is compatible with 64-bits. This attribute is mandatory on 64-bit systems |
| Data Type | LongPtr | A variable data type which is a 4-bytes data type on 32-bit versions and an 8-byte data type on 64-bit versions of Office 2010. This is the recommended way of declaring a pointer or a handle for new code but also for legacy code if it has to run in the 64-bit version of Office 2010. It is only supported in the VBA 7 runtime on 32-bit and 64-bit. Note that you can assign numeric values to it but not numeric types |
| Data Type | LongLong | This is an 8-byte data type which is available only in 64-bit versions of Office 2010. You can assign numeric values but not numeric types (to avoid truncation) |
| Conversion | Operator | CLngPtr    Converts a simple expression to a LongPtr data type |
| Conversion | Operator | CLngLng    Converts a simple expression to a LongLong data type |
| Function | VarPtr | Variant converter. Returns a LongPtr on 64-bit versions, and a Long on 32-bit (4 bytes) |
| Function | ObjPtr | Object converter. Returns a LongPtr on 64-bit versions, and a Long on 32-bit (4 bytes) |
| Function | StrPtr | String converter. Returns a LongPtr on 64-bit versions, and a Long on 32-bit (4 bytes) |

- [Win32API_PtrSafe with 64-bit Support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=9970) (Office 2010, Microsoft)

## API declaration and usage
[Declaring a DLL procedure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa716201(v=vs.60).aspx) to work with different VBA versions:

    Option Explicit
    
    #If Win64 Then

        Private Declare PtrSafe Sub xLib "Kernel32" Alias "Sleep" (ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long)

    #ElseIf Win32 Then

        Private Declare Sub apiSleep Lib "Kernel32" Alias "Sleep" (ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long)

    #End If

The above declaration tells VBA how to call the function "Sleep" defined in file Kernel32.dll

Win64 and Win32 are predefined constants used for [conditional compilation](https://www.wikiod.com/vba/conditional-compilation)

---

Pre-defined Constants

Some compilation constants are already pre-defined. Which ones exist will depend on the bitness of the office version you're running VBA in. Note that Vba7 was introduced alongside Office 2010 to support 64 bit versions of Office.

|**Constant**|**16 bit**|**32 bit**|**64 bit**|
|--------|------|------|------|
|Vba6|False|If Vba6|False|
|Vba7|False|If Vba7|True|
|Win16|True|False|False|
|Win32|False|True|True|
|Win64|False|False|True|
|Mac|False|If Mac|If Mac|

These constants refer to the Office version, not the Windows version. For example Win32 = TRUE in 32-bit Office, even if the OS is a 64-bit version of Windows.

The main difference when declaring APIs is between 32 bit and 64 bit Office versions which introduced new parameter types (see Remarks section for more details)

> Notes: 
> - Declarations are placed at the top of the module, and outside any Subs or Functions
> - Procedures declared in standard modules are public by default
> - To declare a procedure private to a module precede the declaration with the `Private` keyword
> - DLL procedures declared in any other type of module are private to that module

---

Simple example for the Sleep API call:

    Public Sub TestPause()

        Dim start As Double
    
        start = Timer

        Sleep 9000      'Pause execution for 9 seconds

        Debug.Print "Paused for " & Format(Timer - start, "#,###.000") & " seconds"

        'Immediate window result: Paused for 9.000 seconds

    End Sub

---

It is recommended to create a dedicated API module to provide easy access to the system functions from VBA wrappers -- normal VBA Subs or Functions that encapsulate the details needed for the actual system call such as parameters used in libraries, and initialization of those parameters

The module can contain all declarations and dependencies:
- Method signatures and required data structures
- Wrappers that perform input validation, and ensure all parameters are passed as expected

---

To declare a DLL procedure, add a `Declare` statement to the Declarations section of the code window.

If the procedure returns a value, declare it as a **Function**:

    Declare Function publicname Lib "libname" [Alias "alias"] [([[ByVal] variable [As type] [,[ByVal] variable [As type]]...])] As Type

If a procedure does not return a value, declare it as a **Sub**:

    Declare Sub publicname Lib "libname" [Alias "alias"] [([[ByVal] variable [As type] [,[ByVal] variable [As type]]...])]

**Office 2011 for Mac**

    Private Declare Function system Lib "libc.dylib" (ByVal command As String) As Long
    
    Sub RunSafari()
        Dim result As Long
        result = system("open -a Safari --args http://www.google.com")
        Debug.Print Str(result)
    End Sub

[Microsoft doesn't officially support APIs][1] but with some research more declarations can be found online

Office 2016 for Mac is sandboxed

Unlike other versions of Office apps that support VBA, Office 2016 for Mac apps are sandboxed.

Sandboxing restricts the apps from accessing resources outside the app container. This affects any add-ins or macros that involve file access or communication across processes. You can minimize the effects of sandboxing by using the new commands described in the following section.
New VBA commands for Office 2016 for Mac

The following VBA commands are new and unique to Office 2016 for Mac.

| Command| Use to|
| ------ | ------ |
| [GrantAccessToMultipleFiles][2] | Request a user's permission to access multiple files at once | Request a user's permission to access multiple files at once |
| [AppleScriptTask][3] | Call external AppleScript scripts from VB |
| [MAC_OFFICE_VERSION][4] | IFDEF between different Mac Office versions at compile time |
