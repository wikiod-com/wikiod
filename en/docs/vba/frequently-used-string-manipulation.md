Quick examples for MID LEFT and RIGHT string functions using INSTR FIND and LEN.

How do you find the text between two search terms (Say: after a colon and before a comma)?
How do you get the remainder of a word (using MID or using RIGHT)? Which of these functions use Zero-based params and return codes vs One-based? What happens when things go wrong? How do they handle empty strings, unfound results and negative numbers?

## String manipulation frequently used examples
Better MID() and other string extraction examples, currently lacking from the web. Please help me make a good example, or complete this one here. Something like this: 

    DIM strEmpty as String, strNull as String, theText as String
    DIM idx as Integer
    DIM letterCount as Integer
    DIM result as String
    
    strNull = NOTHING
    strEmpty = ""
    theText = "1234, 78910"  
    
    ' -----------------
    ' Extract the word after the comma ", "  and before "910"  result: "78" ***
    ' -----------------
    
    ' Get index (place) of comma using INSTR
    idx = ...   ' some explanation here
    if idx < ... ' check if no comma found in text

    ' or get index of comma using FIND
    idx = ...   ' some explanation here... Note: The difference is...
    if idx < ...  ' check if no comma found in text

    result = MID(theText, ..., LEN(...

    ' Retrieve remaining word after the comma
    result = MID(theText, idx+1, LEN(theText) - idx+1)

    ' Get word until the comma using LEFT
    result = LEFT(theText, idx - 1)

    ' Get remaining text after the comma-and-space using RIGHT
    result = ...

    ' What happens when things go wrong
    result = MID(strNothing, 1, 2)    ' this causes ...
    result = MID(strEmpty, 1, 2) ' which causes...
    result = MID(theText, 30, 2) ' and now...
    result = MID(theText, 2, 999) ' no worries...
    result = MID(theText, 0, 2)
    result = MID(theText, 2, 0)
    result = MID(theText -1, 2)
    result = MID(theText 2, -1)
    idx = INSTR(strNothing, "123")
    idx = INSTR(theText, strNothing)
    idx = INSTR(theText, strEmpty) 
    i = LEN(strEmpty) 
    i = LEN(strNothing) '...
    
Please feel free to edit this example and make it better. As long as it remains clear, and has in it common usage practices.
