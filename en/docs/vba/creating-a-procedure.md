## Introduction to procedures
A `Sub` is a procedure that performs a specific task but does not return a specific value.

    Sub ProcedureName ([argument_list])
        [statements]
    End Sub

If no access modifier is specified, a procedure is `Public` by default.

A `Function` is a procedure that is given data and returns a value, ideally without global or module-scope side-effects.

    Function ProcedureName ([argument_list]) [As ReturnType]
        [statements]
    End Function

A `Property` is a procedure that *encapsulates* module data. A property can have up to 3 accessors: `Get` to return a value or object reference, `Let` to assign a value, and/or `Set` to assign an object reference.

    Property Get|Let|Set PropertyName([argument_list]) [As ReturnType]
        [statements]
    End Property

Properties are usually used in class modules (although they are allowed in standard modules as well), exposing accessor to data that is otherwise inaccessible to the calling code. A property that only exposes a `Get` accessor is "read-only"; a property that would only expose a `Let` and/or `Set` accessor is "write-only". Write-only properties are not considered a good programming practice - if the client code can *write* a value, it should be able to *read* it back. Consider implementing a `Sub` procedure instead of making a write-only property.

# Returning a value

A `Function` or `Property Get` procedure can (and should!) return a value to its caller. This is done by assigning the identifier of the procedure:

    Property Get Foo() As Integer
        Foo = 42
    End Property

## Function With Examples
As stated above Functions are smaller procedures that contain small pieces of code which may be repetitive inside a Procedure. 

Functions are used to reduce redundancy in code.

Similar to a Procedure, A function can be declared with or without an arguments list.

Function is declared as a return type, as all functions return a value.
The Name and the Return Variable of a function are the Same.

1. Function With Parameter:

        Function check_even(i as integer) as boolean
        if (i mod  2) = 0 then
        check_even = True
        else
        check_even=False
        end if
        end Function

2. Function Without Parameter:
      
        Function greet() as String
        greet= "Hello Coder!"
        end Function


The Function can be called in various ways inside a function. Since a Function declared with a return type is basically a variable. it is used similar to a variable.

Functional Calls:
      
        call greet() 'Similar to a Procedural call just allows the Procedure to use the
                     'variable greet 
        string_1=greet() 'The Return value of the function is used for variable
                         'assignment

Further the function can also be used as conditions for if and other conditional statements.
          
          for i = 1 to 10
          if check_even(i) then
          msgbox i & " is Even"
          else
          msgbox i & " is Odd"
          end if
          next i

Further more Functions can have modifiers such as By ref and By val for their arguments.
