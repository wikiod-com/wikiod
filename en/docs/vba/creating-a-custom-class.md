This article will show how to create a complete custom class in VBA. It uses the example of a `DateRange` object, because a starting and ending date are often passed together to functions.

## Adding a Property to a Class
A `Property` procedure is a series of statement that retrieves or modifies a custom property on a module.

There are three types of property accessors:

 1. A `Get` procedure that returns the value of a property.
 2. A `Let` procedure that assigns a (non-`Object`) value to an object.
 3. A `Set` procedure that assigns an `Object` reference.

Property accessors are often defined in pairs, using both a `Get` and `Let`/`Set` for each property. A property with only a `Get` procedure would be read-only, while a property with only a `Let`/`Set` procedure would be write-only.

In the following example, four property accessors are defined for the `DateRange` class:

 1. `StartDate` (*read/write*). Date value representing the earlier date in a range. Each procedure uses the value of the module variable, `mStartDate`.
 2. `EndDate` (*read/write*). Date value representing the later date in a range. Each procedure uses the value of the module variable, `mEndDate`.
 3. `DaysBetween` (*read-only*). Calculated Integer value representing the number of days between the two dates. Because there is only a `Get` procedure, this property cannot be modified directly.
 4. `RangeToCopy` (*write-only*). A `Set` procedure used to copy the values of an existing `DateRange` object.



    Private mStartDate As Date                ' Module variable to hold the starting date
    Private mEndDate As Date                  ' Module variable to hold the ending date
      
    ' Return the current value of the starting date
    Public Property Get StartDate() As Date
        StartDate = mStartDate
    End Property
    
    ' Set the starting date value. Note that two methods have the name StartDate
    Public Property Let StartDate(ByVal NewValue As Date)
        mStartDate = NewValue
    End Property
      
    ' Same thing, but for the ending date
    Public Property Get EndDate() As Date
        EndDate = mEndDate
    End Property
      
    Public Property Let EndDate(ByVal NewValue As Date)
        mEndDate = NewValue
    End Property
    
    ' Read-only property that returns the number of days between the two dates
    Public Property Get DaysBetween() As Integer
        DaysBetween = DateDiff("d", mStartDate, mEndDate)
    End Function
    
    ' Write-only property that passes an object reference of a range to clone
    Public Property Set RangeToCopy(ByRef ExistingRange As DateRange)
    
    Me.StartDate = ExistingRange.StartDate
    Me.EndDate = ExistingRange.EndDate
    
    End Property



## Adding Functionality to a Class
Any public `Sub`, `Function`, or `Property` inside a class module can be called by preceding the call with an object reference:

    Object.Procedure

In a `DateRange` class, a `Sub` could be used to add a number of days to the end date:

    Public Sub AddDays(ByVal NoDays As Integer)
        mEndDate = mEndDate + NoDays
    End Sub

A `Function` could return the last day of the next month-end (note that `GetFirstDayOfMonth` would not be visible outside the class because it is private):

    Public Function GetNextMonthEndDate() As Date
        GetNextMonthEndDate = DateAdd("m", 1, GetFirstDayOfMonth())
    End Function
    
    Private Function GetFirstDayOfMonth() As Date
        GetFirstDayOfMonth = DateAdd("d", -DatePart("d", mEndDate), mEndDate)
    End Function

Procedures can accept arguments of any type, including references to objects of the class being defined. 

The following example tests whether the current `DateRange` object has a starting date and ending date that includes the starting and ending date of another `DateRange` object.

    Public Function ContainsRange(ByRef TheRange As DateRange) As Boolean
        ContainsRange = TheRange.StartDate >= Me.StartDate And TheRange.EndDate <= Me.EndDate
    End Function

Note the use of the `Me` notation as a way to access the value of the object running the code.



## Class module scope, instancing and re-use
By default, a new class module is a Private class, so it is *only* available for instantiation and use within the VBProject in which it is defined. You can declare, instantiate and use the class anywhere in the *same* project:

    'Class List has Instancing set to Private
    'In any other module in the SAME project, you can use:

    Dim items As List
    Set items = New List

But often you'll write classes that you'd like to use in other projects *without* copying the module between projects. If you define a class called `List` in `ProjectA`, and want to use that class in `ProjectB`, then you'll need to perform 4 actions:

1. Change the instancing property of the `List` class in `ProjectA` in the Properties window, from `Private` to `PublicNotCreatable`

2. Create a public "factory" function in `ProjectA` that creates and returns an instance of a `List` class. Typically the factory function would include arguments for the initialization of the class instance. The factory function is required because the class can be used by `ProjectB` but `ProjectB` cannot directly create an instance of `ProjectA`'s class.

        Public Function CreateList(ParamArray values() As Variant) As List
            Dim tempList As List
            Dim itemCounter As Long
            Set tempList = New List
            For itemCounter = LBound(values) to UBound(values) 
                tempList.Add values(itemCounter)
            Next itemCounter
            Set CreateList = tempList
        End Function

3. In `ProjectB` add a reference to `ProjectA` using the `Tools..References...` menu.

4. In `ProjectB`, declare a variable and assign it an instance of `List` using the factory function from `ProjectA`

        Dim items As ProjectA.List
        Set items = ProjectA.CreateList("foo","bar")
    
        'Use the items list methods and properties
        items.Add "fizz"
        Debug.Print items.ToString()
        'Destroy the items object
        Set items = Nothing
