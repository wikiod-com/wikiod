Unity provides a cross platform game development environment for developers. Developers can use C# language and/or JavaScript syntax based UnityScript for programming the game. Target deployment platforms can be switched easily in the editor. All core game code stays same except some platform dependent features. A list of all the versions and corresponding downloads and release notes can be found here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive.
