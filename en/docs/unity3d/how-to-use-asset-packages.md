## Asset packages
[Asset Packages][1] (with the file format of `.unitypackage`) are a commonly used way of distributing Unity projects to other users. When working with peripherals that have their own SDKs (eg. [Oculus](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/)), you may be asked to download and import one of these packages.

## Importing a .unitypackage

To import a package, go to the Unity menu bar and click on `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...`, then navigate to the `.unitypackage` file in the File Browser that appears.
