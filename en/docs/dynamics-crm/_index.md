Microsoft Dynamics CRM SDK allows developers to extend the Microsoft Dynamics CRM product, add new functionalities and meet requirements.

The SDK allows you to operate and communicate with the platform programmatically through web service messages, as well as to add custom code components like plug-ins, custom workflows and custom actions.

The Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides a JavaScript SDK library called Xrm on the client-side, which allows extending the user interface and experience.
