GTK+ 3 also known as Gtk3 is a multi-platform GUI toolkit, it is written in C but has bindings for a lot of languages including C++, Python, Vala and Ruby. (For the full list see [the Gtk website][1]). 

Gtk+ is part of the [GNU Project][2] and falls under the GNU LGPL licences meaning it is allowed to be used by all developers, including those developing proprietary software, without any license fees or royalties.
