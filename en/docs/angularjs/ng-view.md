ng-view is one of in-build directive that angular uses as a container to switch between views. {info} ngRoute is no longer a part of the base angular.js file, so you'll need to include the angular-route.js file after your the base angular javascript file.
We can configure a route by using the “when” function of the $routeProvider. We need to first specify the route, then in a second parameter provide an object with a templateUrl property and a controller property.

## ng-view
`ng-view` is a directive used with `$route` to render a partial view in the main page layout. Here in this example, Index.html is our main file and when user lands on "/" route the templateURL home.html will be rendered in Index.html where `ng-view` is mentioned.

    angular.module('ngApp', ['ngRoute'])
    
    .config(function($routeProvider){
      $routeProvider.when("/",
        {
          templateUrl: "home.html",
          controller: "homeCtrl"
        }
      );
    });

    angular.module('ngApp').controller('homeCtrl',['$scope', function($scope) {
      $scope.welcome= "Welcome to stackoverflow!";
    }]);
    
    //Index.html
    <body ng-app="ngApp">
        <div ng-view></div>
    </body>

    //Home Template URL or home.html
    <div><h2>{{welcome}}</h2></div>

## Registration navigation
   

 1. We injecting the module in the application


      var Registration=angular.module("myApp",["ngRoute"]);

2. now we use $routeProvider from "ngRoute"


        Registration.config(function($routeProvider) {
 
    });
3. finally we integrating the route, we define  "/add" routing to the application in case application get "/add" it divert to regi.htm


     Registration.config(function($routeProvider) {
        $routeProvider
        .when("/add", {
            templateUrl : "regi.htm"
        })
    });
