## Accessing a filtered list from outside an ng-repeat
Occasionally you will want to access the result of your filters from outside the `ng-repeat`, perhaps to indicate the number of items that have been filtered out. You can do this using `as [variablename]` syntax on the `ng-repeat`.

```
<ul>
  <li ng-repeat="item in vm.listItems | filter:vm.myFilter as filtered">
    {{item.name}}
  </li>
</ul>
<span>Showing {{filtered.length}} of {{vm.listItems.length}}</span>
```

## Custom filter to remove values
A typical use case for a filter is to remove values from an array. In this example we pass in an array and remove any nulls found in it, returning the array.

    function removeNulls() {
        return function(list) {
            for (var i = list.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (typeof list[i] === 'undefined' ||
                        list[i] === null) {
                    list.splice(i, 1);
                }
            }
            return list;
        };
    }

That would be used in the HTML like

    {{listOfItems | removeNulls}}

or in a controller like

    listOfItems = removeNullsFilter(listOfItems);

## Custom filter to format values
Another use case for filters is to format a single value. In this example, we pass in a value and we are returned an appropriate true boolean value.

    function convertToBooleanValue() {
        return function(input) {
            if (typeof input !== 'undefined' &&
                    input !== null &&
                    (input === true || input === 1 || input === '1' || input
                            .toString().toLowerCase() === 'true')) {
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        };
    }

Which in the HTML would be used like this:

    {{isAvailable | convertToBooleanValue}}

Or in a controller like:

    var available = convertToBooleanValueFilter(isAvailable);

## Performing filter in a child array
This example was done in order to demonstrate how you can perform a deep filter in a *child* array without the necessity of a custom filter.

**Controller:**

    (function() {
      "use strict";
      angular
        .module('app', [])
        .controller('mainCtrl', mainCtrl);
    
      function mainCtrl() {
        var vm = this;
      
        vm.classifications = ["Saloons", "Sedans", "Commercial vehicle", "Sport car"];
        vm.cars = [  
           {  
              "name":"car1",
              "classifications":[  
                 {  
                    "name":"Saloons"
                 },
                 {  
                    "name":"Sedans"
                 }
              ]
           },
           {  
              "name":"car2",
              "classifications":[  
                 {  
                    "name":"Saloons"
                 },
                 {  
                    "name":"Commercial vehicle"
                 }
              ]
           },
           {  
              "name":"car3",
              "classifications":[  
                 {  
                    "name":"Sport car"
                 },
                 {  
                    "name":"Sedans"
                 }
              ]
           }
        ];
      }
    })();

**View:**
    
    <body ng-app="app" ng-controller="mainCtrl as main">
      Filter car by classification:
      <select ng-model="classificationName"
              ng-options="classification for classification in main.classifications"></select>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="car in main.cars |
                       filter: { classifications: { name: classificationName } } track by $index"
                      ng-bind-template="{{car.name}} - {{car.classifications | json}}">
        </li>
      </ul>
    </body>

## Using filters in a controller or service
By injecting `$filter`, any defined filter in your Angular module may be used in controllers, services, directives or even other filters.

```js
angular.module("app")
  .service("users", usersService)
  .controller("UsersController", UsersController);

function usersService () {
  this.getAll = function () {
    return [{
      id: 1,
      username: "john"
    }, {
      id: 2,
      username: "will"
    }, {
      id: 3,
      username: "jack"
    }];
  };
}

function UsersController ($filter, users) {
  var orderByFilter = $filter("orderBy");

  this.users = orderByFilter(users.getAll(), "username");
  // Now the users are ordered by their usernames: jack, john, will

  this.users = orderByFilter(users.getAll(), "username", true);
  // Now the users are ordered by their usernames, in reverse order: will, john, jack
}
```

## Your First Filter
Filters are a special type of function that can modify how something is printed out to the page, or can be used to filter an array, or a `ng-repeat` action. You can create a filter by calling the `app.filter()` method, passing it a name and a function. See the examples below for details on syntax.

----

For example, let's create a filter that will change a string to be all uppercase (essentially a wrapper of the `.toUpperCase()` javascript function):
    
    var app = angular.module("MyApp", []);
    
    // just like making a controller, you must give the
    // filter a unique name, in this case "toUppercase"
    app.filter('toUppercase', function(){
        // all the filter does is return a function,
        // which acts as the "filtering" function
        return function(rawString){
            // The filter function takes in the value,
            // which we modify in some way, then return
            // back.
            return rawString.toUpperCase();
        };
    }); 

Let's take a closer look at what's happening above. 

First, we're creating a filter called "toUppercase", which is just like a controller; `app.filter(...)`. Then, that filter's function returns the actual filter function. That function takes a single object, which is the object to be filtered, and should return the filtered version of the object.

**Note:** *In this situation, we're assuming the object being passed into the filter is a string, and therefore know to always use the filter only on strings. That being said, a further improvement to the filter could be made that loops through the object (if it's an array) and then makes every element that is a string uppercase.*

Now let's use our new filter in action. Our filter can be used in two ways, either in an angular template or as a javascript function (as an injected Angular reference).

## Javascript

Simply inject the angular `$filter` object to your controller, then use that to retrieve the filter function using its name.

    app.controller("MyController", function($scope, $filter){
        this.rawString = "Foo";
        this.capsString = $filter("toUppercase")(this.rawString);
    });

## HTML

For an angular directive, use the pipe (`|`) symbol followed by the filter name in the directive after the actual string. For example, let's say we have a controller called `MyController` that has a string called `rawString` as a element of it.

    <div ng-controller="MyController as ctrl">
        <span>Capital rawString: {{ ctrl.rawString | toUppercase }}</span>
    </div>

---

**Editor's Note:** *Angular has a number of built in filters, including "uppercase", and the "toUppercase" filter is intended only as a demo to easily show off how filters work, but you do* not *need to built your own uppercase function.*
