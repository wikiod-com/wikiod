## Syntax
 - $scope.$watch(watchExpression, callback, [deep compare]) 
 - $scope.$digest()
 - $scope.$apply([exp])

## $digest and $watch
Implementing two-way-data-binding, to achieve the result from the previous example, could be done with two core functions:

 - **$digest** is called after a user interaction (binding DOM=>variable)
 - **$watch** sets a callback to be called after variable changes (binding variable=>DOM)

***note: this is example is a demonstration, not the actual angular code***

***

    <input id="input"/>
    <span id="span"></span>

The two functions we need:

    var $watches = [];
    function $digest(){
        $watches.forEach(function($w){
            var val = $w.val();
            if($w.prevVal !== val){
                $w.callback(val, $w.prevVal);
                $w.prevVal = val;
            }
        })
    }
    function $watch(val, callback){
        $watches.push({val:val, callback:callback, prevVal: val() })
    }

Now we could now use these functions to hook up a variable to the DOM (angular comes with built-in directives which will do this for you): 

    var realVar;    
    //this is usually done by ng-model directive
    input1.addEventListener('keyup',function(e){
        realVar=e.target.value; 
        $digest()
    }, true);

    //this is usually done with {{expressions}} or ng-bind directive
    $watch(function(){return realVar},function(val){
        span1.innerHTML = val;
    });

Off-course, the real implementations are more complex, and support parameters such as **which element** to bind to, and **what variable** to use

A running example could be found here: https://jsfiddle.net/azofxd4j/

## the $scope tree
The previous example is good enough when we need to bind a single html element, to a single variable.

In reality - we need to bind many elements to many variables:

    <span ng-repeat="number in [1,2,3,4,5]">{{number}}</span>

This `ng-repeat` binds 5 elements to 5 variables called `number`, with a different value for each of them!

***

The way angular achieves this behavior is using a separate context for each element which needs separate variables. This context is called a scope. 

Each scope contains properties, which are the variables bound to the DOM, and the `$digest` and `$watch` functions are implemented as methods of the scope.

The DOM is a tree, and variables need to be used in different levels of the tree:

    <div>
        <input ng-model="person.name" />
        <span ng-repeat="number in [1,2,3,4,5]">{{number}} {{person.name}}</span>
    </div>

But as we saw, the context(or scope) of variables inside `ng-repeat` is different to the context above it.
To solve this - angular implements scopes as a tree.

Each scope has an array of children, and calling its `$digest` method will run all of its children's `$digest` method.

This way - after changing the input - `$digest` is called for the div's scope, which then runs the `$digest` for its 5 children - which will update its content.

***

A simple implementation for a scope, could look like this:

    function $scope(){
        this.$children = [];
        this.$watches = [];
    }

    $scope.prototype.$digest = function(){
        this.$watches.forEach(function($w){
            var val = $w.val();
            if($w.prevVal !== val){
                $w.callback(val, $w.prevVal);
              $w.prevVal = val;
            }
        });
        this.$children.forEach(function(c){
            c.$digest();
        });
    }

    $scope.prototype.$watch = function(val, callback){
        this.$watches.push({val:val, callback:callback, prevVal: val() })
    }

***note: this is example is a demonstration, not the actual angular code***

## two way data binding
Angular has some magic under its hood. it enables binding [DOM][1] to real js variables.

Angular uses a loop, named the "*digest loop*", which is called after any change of a variable - calling callbacks which update the DOM.

For example, the `ng-model` directive attaches a `keyup` [eventListener][2] to this input:

    <input ng-model="variable" />

 Every time the `keyup` event fires, the *digest loop* starts.

At some point, the *digest loop* iterates over a callback which updates the contents of this span:

    <span>{{variable}}</span>


The basic life-cycle of this example, summarizes (very Schematically) how angular works::

 1. Angular scans html
     - `ng-model` directive creates a `keyup` listener on input
     - `expression` inside span adds a callback to *digest cycle*
 2. User interacts with input
     - `keyup` listener starts *digest cycle*
     - *digest cycle* calles the callback
     - Callback updates span's contents
