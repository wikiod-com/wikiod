Neural networks, in the tech field, are useful for statistic regression, data classification, product recommentation, computer vision, natural language understanding and synthesis, speech to text, text to speech, and many other complex tasks. Neural networks are used in machine learning and in deep learning, they are related to artificial intelligence. 

A neural network learns by example, it is meant to be trained with data in, data out, to later be able to predict the output given an input similar to what it was trained on. 

Many framework exists for programming, training and using artificial neural network. Here are some of the most known machine-learning frameworks: 
- Tensorflow
- Caffe
- Keras
- Theano
- Torch
- DL4J
