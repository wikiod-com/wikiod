Slick Slider is easy to use and to customise. It provides good amount of customisation options including responsive options based on breakpoints.

To get started with slick, it is not that difficult. Just download the js and css files from their website, create your html code and fire the plugin using single line of jQuery as shown below:

HTML: 

    <div class="your-class">
      <div>your content</div>
      <div>your content</div>
      <div>your content</div>
    </div>

jQuery:

`$('.single-item').slick();`

This will start the slick slider. You can then customise the options for the look that you want to achive.
