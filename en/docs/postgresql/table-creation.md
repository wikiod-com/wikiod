## Table creation with Primary Key
    CREATE TABLE person (
        person_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        first_name VARCHAR(255),
        address VARCHAR(255),
        city VARCHAR(255),
        PRIMARY KEY (person_id)
    );

Alternatively, you can place the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint directly in the column definition:

    CREATE TABLE person (
        person_id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        first_name VARCHAR(255),
        address VARCHAR(255),
        city VARCHAR(255)
    );

It is recommended that you use lower case names for the table and as well as all the columns. If you use upper case names such as `Person` you would have to wrap that name in double quotes (`"Person"`) in each and every query because PostgreSQL enforces case folding.


## Show table definition
Open the `psql` command line tool connected to the database where your table is. Then type the following command:

    \d tablename

To get extended information type

    \d+ tablename

If you have forgotten the name of the table, just type \d into psql to obtain a list of tables and views in the current database.

## Create table from select
Let's say you have a table called person:

    CREATE TABLE person (
        person_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
        last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        first_name VARCHAR(255),
        age INT NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (person_id)
    );     

You can create a new table of people over 30 like this: 

    CREATE TABLE people_over_30 AS SELECT * FROM person WHERE age > 30;

## Create unlogged table
You can create unlogged tables so that you can make the tables considerably faster. Unlogged table skips writing `write-ahead` log which means it's not crash-safe and unable to replicate.

    CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE person (
        person_id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        first_name VARCHAR(255),
        address VARCHAR(255),
        city VARCHAR(255)
    );

## Create a table that references other table.
In this example, User Table will have a column that references the Agency table.


```
CREATE TABLE agencies ( -- first create the agency table
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  agency_id NOT NULL INTEGER REFERENCES agencies(id) DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED -- this is going to references your agency table.
)
```
