## generic example
Preparing data:

    create table wf_example(i int, t text,ts timestamptz,b boolean);
    insert into wf_example select 1,'a','1970.01.01',true;
    insert into wf_example select 1,'a','1970.01.01',false;
    insert into wf_example select 1,'b','1970.01.01',false;
    insert into wf_example select 2,'b','1970.01.01',false;
    insert into wf_example select 3,'b','1970.01.01',false;
    insert into wf_example select 4,'b','1970.02.01',false;
    insert into wf_example select 5,'b','1970.03.01',false;
    insert into wf_example select 2,'c','1970.03.01',true;
Running:

    select *
      , dense_rank() over (order by i) dist_by_i 
      , lag(t) over () prev_t 
      , nth_value(i, 6) over () nth
      , count(true) over (partition by i) num_by_i 
      , count(true) over () num_all
      , ntile(3) over() ntile
    from wf_example
    ;
Result:

     i | t |           ts           | b | dist_by_i | prev_t | nth | num_by_i | num_all | ntile
    ---+---+------------------------+---+-----------+--------+-----+----------+---------+-------

     3 | b | 1970-01-01 00:00:00+01 | f |         3 | b      |   3 |        1 |       8 |     2
     4 | b | 1970-02-01 00:00:00+01 | f |         4 | b      |   3 |        1 |       8 |     3
     5 | b | 1970-03-01 00:00:00+01 | f |         5 | b      |   3 |        1 |       8 |     3
    (8 rows)

Explanation:

*dist_by_i*: `dense_rank() over (order by i)` is like a row_number per distinct values. Can be used for the number of distinct values of i (`count(DISTINCT i)` wold not work). Just use the maximum value. 
 
*prev_t*: `lag(t) over ()` is a previous value of t over the whole window. mind that it is null for the first row.

*nth*: `nth_value(i, 6) over ()` is the value of sixth rows column i over the whole window 

*num_by_i*: `count(true) over (partition by i)` is an amount of rows for each value of i

*num_all*: `count(true) over ()`  is an amount of rows over a whole window

*ntile*: `ntile(3) over()` splits the whole window to 3 (as much as possible) equal in quantity parts



## column values vs dense_rank vs rank vs row_number
[here][1] you can find the functions.

With the table wf_example created in previous example, run:

    select i
      , dense_rank() over (order by i)
      , row_number() over ()
      , rank() over (order by i)
    from wf_example
The result is:

     i | dense_rank | row_number | rank
    ---+------------+------------+------
     1 |          1 |          1 |    1
     1 |          1 |          2 |    1
     1 |          1 |          3 |    1
     2 |          2 |          4 |    4
     2 |          2 |          5 |    4
     3 |          3 |          6 |    6
     4 |          4 |          7 |    7
     5 |          5 |          8 |    8

- *dense_rank* orders **VALUES** of **i** by appearance in window. `i=1` appears, so first row has dense_rank, next and third i value does not change, so it is `dense_rank` shows *1* - FIRST value not changed. fourth row `i=2`, it is second value of *i* met, so `dense_rank` shows 2, andso for the next row. Then it meets value `i=3` at 6th row, so it show 3. Same for the rest two values of *i*. So the last value of `dense_rank` is the number of distinct values of *i*.

- *row_number* orders **ROWS** as they are listed.

- *rank* Not to confuse with `dense_rank` this function orders **ROW NUMBER** of **i** values. So it starts same with three ones, but has next value 4, which means `i=2` (new value) was met at row 4. Same `i=3` was met at row 6. Etc..
