## Insert data using COPY
COPY is PostgreSQL's bulk-insert mechanism. It's a convenient way to transfer data between files and tables, but it's also far faster than `INSERT` when adding more than a few thousand rows at a time. 

Let's begin by creating sample data file.

    cat > samplet_data.csv

    1,Yogesh
    2,Raunak
    3,Varun
    4,Kamal
    5,Hari
    6,Amit

And we need a two column table into which this data can be imported into.

    CREATE TABLE copy_test(id int, name varchar(8));

Now the actual copy operation, this will create six records in the table.

    COPY copy_test FROM '/path/to/file/sample_data.csv' DELIMITER ',';

Instead of using a file on disk, can insert data from `stdin`

    COPY copy_test FROM stdin DELIMITER ',';
    Enter data to be copied followed by a newline.
    End with a backslash and a period on a line by itself.
    >> 7,Amol
    >> 8,Amar
    >> \.
    Time: 85254.306 ms

    SELECT * FROM copy_test ;
     id |  name
    ----+--------
      1 | Yogesh
      3 | Varun
      5 | Hari
      7 | Amol
      2 | Raunak
      4 | Kamal
      6 | Amit
      8 | Amar

Also you can copy data from a table to file as below:

    COPY copy_test TO 'path/to/file/sample_data.csv'  DELIMITER ',';

## Inserting multiple rows
You can insert multiple rows in the database at the same time:

    INSERT INTO person (name, age) VALUES 
      ('john doe', 25),
      ('jane doe', 20);



## INSERT data and RETURING values
If you are inserting data into a table with an auto increment column and if you want to get the value of the auto increment column.

Say you have a table called `my_table`:

    CREATE TABLE my_table
    (
    id serial NOT NULL, -- serial data type is auto incrementing four-byte integer
    name character varying,
    contact_number integer,
    CONSTRAINT my_table_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );

If you want to insert data into `my_table` and get the id of that row:

    INSERT INTO my_table(name, contact_number) VALUES ( 'USER', 8542621) RETURNING id;

Above query will return the id of the row where the new record was inserted.

## Basic INSERT
Let's say we have a simple table called person:

    CREATE TABLE person (
        person_id BIGINT,
        name VARCHAR(255).
        age INT,
        city VARCHAR(255)
    );

The most basic insert involves inserting all values in the table:

    INSERT INTO person VALUES (1, 'john doe', 25, 'new york');

If you want to insert only specific columns, you need to explicitly indicate which columns:

    INSERT INTO person (name, age) VALUES ('john doe', 25);

Note that if any constraints exist on the table , such as NOT NULL, you will be required to include those columns in either case.

## Insert from select
You can insert data in a table as the result of a select statement:

    INSERT INTO person SELECT * FROM tmp_person WHERE age < 30;

Note that the projection of the select must match the columns required for the insert. In this case, the `tmp_person ` table has the same columns as `person`.

## SELECT data into file.
You can COPY table and paste it into a file.
    
    postgres=# select * from my_table;
     c1 | c2 | c3 
    ----+----+----
      1 |  1 |  1
      2 |  2 |  2
      3 |  3 |  3
      4 |  4 |  4
      5 |  5 |   
    (5 rows)

    postgres=# copy my_table to '/home/postgres/my_table.txt' using delimiters '|' with null as 'null_string' csv header;
    COPY 5
    postgres=# \! cat my_table.txt
    c1|c2|c3
    1|1|1
    2|2|2
    3|3|3
    4|4|4
    5|5|null_string

## UPSERT - INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE...
since [version 9.5][1] postgres offers `UPSERT` functionality with `INSERT` statement.

Say you have a table called my_table, created in several previous examples. We insert a row, returning PK value of inserted row:

    b=# INSERT INTO my_table (name,contact_number) values ('one',333) RETURNING id;
     id
    ----
      2
    (1 row)
    
    INSERT 0 1
Now if we try to insert row with existing unique key it will raise an exception:

    b=# INSERT INTO my_table values (2,'one',333);
    ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "my_table_pkey"
    DETAIL:  Key (id)=(2) already exists.
Upsert functionality offers ability to insert it anyway, solving the conflict:

    b=# INSERT INTO my_table values (2,'one',333) ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET name = my_table.name||' changed to: "two" at '||now() returning *;
     id |                       name                             | contact_number
    ----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------
      2 | one changed to: "two" at 2016-11-23 08:32:17.105179+00 |            333
    (1 row)
    
    INSERT 0 1
