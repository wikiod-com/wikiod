"A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing â€“ hence "field-programmable". The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)." per [Wikipedia][1]

It should also mention any large subjects within fpga, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for fpga is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.

FPGAs code is usually written using the HDLs [Verilog][2] or [VHDL][3]. FPGAs often include pre-designed logic such as memories and DSP/math functions. FPGAs may include serial transceivers and embedded microprocessors.

There are fours major manufacturers of FPGAs:

 * [Xilinx, Inc.][4]
 * [Intel][5] (who bought [Altera Corp.][6] in 2015)
 * [Microsemi][7] (who bought [Actel Corp.][8] in 2010)
 * [Lattice Semiconductor Corp.][9]
