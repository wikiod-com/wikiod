## What's mvvmcross
Mvvmcross is an open source MVVM platform that comes to solve our problems while developing cross platform applications (such as Android, Windows Phone, IOS, etc...).

The main problem is, that every platform has its own specifics, but the business logic of your application is likely to be the same on each platform.

For instance, if you develop your application for Android and Windows Desktop - your mobile project will have a vibration API while desktop will not. But both desktop and mobile project will have the same authentication mechanism.

Thatâ€™s where Mvvmcross becomes very handy.

The main feature of mvvmcross is that you are separating your logic not only from the views (as in MVVM and MVC patterns), but from specific platform implementation while reusing logic code between platforms.

Your business logic will be implemented in your PCL (Portable Library Class), and each platform can reference it, while implementing its native side accordingly.
