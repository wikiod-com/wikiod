[FusionCharts][1] Suite XT is a JavaScript charting library that supports both, XML and JSON, for rendering interactive charts, gauges, and maps. The suite comes with 90+ charts and gauges (supporting standard and advanced configurations) and 1100+ maps. It also includes support for [server-side wrappers][2] for PHP, Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET, and other such technologies and [client-side plugins][2] for jQuery, ReactJS, and AngularJS.

The FusionCharts Suite XT [free trial version][3] comes with a watermark and can be used for as long as you want, without any feature restrictions. The licensed version comes without the watermark and can be used for commercial applications.
