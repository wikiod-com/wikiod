# Taken from [IdentityServer4 Official Docs][1]
-----------------------------------------------

IdentityServer4 is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET Core.

It enables the following features in your applications:

## Authentication as a Service
Centralized login logic and workflow for all of your applications (web, native, mobile, services).

## Single Sign-on / Sign-out
Single sign-on (and out) over multiple application types.

## Access Control for APIs
Issue access tokens for APIs for various types of clients, e.g. server to server, web applications, SPAs and
native/mobile apps.

## Federation Gateway
Support for external identity providers like Azure Active Directory, Google, Facebook etc.
This shields your applications from the details of how to connect to these external providers.

## Focus on Customization
The most important part - many aspect of IdentityServer can be customized to fit **your** needs.
Since IdentityServer is a framework and not a boxed product or a SaaS, you can write code to adapt the system the way it makes sense for your scenarios.

IdentityServer is officially certified by the OpenID Foundation and part of the .NET Foundation.
