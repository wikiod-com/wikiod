Delphi is a general-purpose language based on an Object Pascal dialect with its roots coming from Borland Turbo Pascal. It comes with its own IDE designed to support rapid application development (RAD).

It allows cross-platform native (compiled) application development from a single code base. Currently supported platforms are Windows, OSX, iOS and Android.

It comes with two visual frameworks: 

 - VCL: Visual Component Library specifically designed for Windows development wrapping Windows native controls and support for creating custom ones.
 - FMX: FireMonkey cross-platform framework for all supported platforms
