Sometime testing our JavaScript code becomes a tough task. Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing our JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean syntax which makes you easily write the tests. You can find the Jasmine documentation [here][1] and the project in [GitHub][2].
