## Overview of Frameworks
Apps written for macOS are usually written with Apple's Frameworks. The frameworks that almost every app will use are:

* AppKit - for creating and managing UI elements
* Foundation - for common non-UI objects and operations

There are other common frameworks that are used in many, but not all apps:

* CoreData - for data storage
* Dispatch - for management of multiple threads
* CoreGraphics - for drawing a graphics related tasks
* CoreAnimation - for animation of UI elements
