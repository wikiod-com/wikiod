In Mac OS X, you can set the environment variables in one of the following files :

~/.bashrc

~/.bash_profile

~/.profile

By default, Mac OS X does not has above files, you need to create it manually.

## Add a path
1.`vim ~/.bash_profile`

The file may not exist (if not, you can just create it).

2.type in this and save the file:

    export PATH=$PATH:YOUR_PATH_HERE
