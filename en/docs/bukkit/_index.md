Bukkit is a simple API that allows for modifying the normal Minecraft multiplayer experience using plugins.

[Bukkit is now discontinued](https://bukkit.org/threads/bukkit-its-time-to-say.305106/), and is no longer available for newer versions of Minecraft. [Spigot, a version of Bukkit that boasts improving server performance](https://www.spigotmc.org) is available. The API for Spigot is essentially the same as Bukkit.
