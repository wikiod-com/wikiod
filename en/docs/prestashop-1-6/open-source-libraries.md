## Smarty
Smarty templating engine for PHP lets easily separate application logic and presentation, the first being in PHP code and the other generally, but not always, in HTML. That way a separation of PHP and HTML code is encouraged.

Currently two versions of Smarty are maintained smarty2 for legacy purposes that is compatible with PHP 4 and PHP 5, and smarty3 that is compatible with PHP 5.2 and newer.

As of August 14th 2016, current Smarty releases are 3.1.30 and 2.6.30
