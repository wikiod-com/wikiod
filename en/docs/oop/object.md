## Introduction
Object is the base module in the __Object Oriented Programming (OOP)__. An Object can be a variable, data structure (like an array, map, etc), or even a function or method. In OOP, we model real world objects like animals, vehicles, etc.

An object can be defined in a class, which can be defined as the blueprint of the object. Then we can create instances of that class, which we call objects. We can use these objects, their methods and variables in our code after.
