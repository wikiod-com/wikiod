**NLTK** is a leading platform for building **Python** programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to [over 50 corpora and lexical resources][1] such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active [discussion forum][2].

# The book

**[Natural Language Processing with Python][3]** provides a practical introduction to programming for language processing. Written by the creators of NLTK, it guides the reader through the fundamentals of writing Python programs, working with corpora, categorizing text, analyzing linguistic structure, and more. The book is being updated for Python 3 and NLTK 3. (The original Python 2 version is still available at http://nltk.org/book_1ed .)
