## What is Postman?
[Postman][1] is an API Development Environment that helps people to build, test, document, monitor and publish documentation for their APIs.

The main features of Postman are

 - [Sending requests][2] (with support for different [authentication schemes][3], [Cookies][4], [certificates][5], headers, query parameters, request body and [SOAP][6] with/without WSDL) and [debugging and saving responses][7].
- Organizing your APIs into groups called as [Collections][8]. 
- [Sharing and collaborating][9] your Collections with your team.
- [Writing tests][10]. The test scripts can run pre-request, after a response has been received, and can have looping and branching concepts.
- The [concept of variables][11] to set and get. As well as globals environment variables.
- Test Automation using [Collection Runs][12]. The collections can also be exported and run in the command line using [Newman][13] as part of your build process.
- You can also schedule tests to be run in an automated fashion by using [Postman Monitors][14].
- A way to auto-generate and customize your [API documentation][15] directly from your collections. It can be private, shared with your team, public and can also be set-up on your custom domain.
- Simulate a backend with [Mock Servers][16].
- [Integrations][17] with services like [Slack][18], [Github][19], [Bitbucket][20], [Datadog][21], [Keen.io][22], [Microsoft Flow][23] and several others.
- [An API][24] that lets you consume the data from Postman as part of your continuous integration and delivery processes.
- A way to import existing APIs from Swagger, RAML, cURL and several other tools.
- Auto-generation of [code snippets][25] in different languages from your APIs.
- [Intercepting requests][26].
- Interactive  [History][27] of all your requests.
- Access Control for your team and [Single Sign On (SSO)][28].
- Core [open sourced][29] components.
