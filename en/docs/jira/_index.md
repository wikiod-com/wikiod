JIRA is interesting for developers in two ways. 1) it is used to track tasks for software development (especially for agile projects) or as bug tracker (see [JIRA User's Guide][1]). 2) JIRA provides a large support for extending functionality with plugins written in Java (see [Create a HelloWorld Plugin Project][2])
