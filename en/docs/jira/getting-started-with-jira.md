## Start a local JIRA instance
The easiest way to run a local JIRA instance, is to install the SDK and run 

    atlas-run-standalone

For further details see https://www.wikiod.com/jira/starting-a-local-jira-test-instance

*Please note that this runs a local test instance and is not meant for production.*

## Installation Guide
There's an installation guide for running a JIRA Server under Windows or Linux / Mac (
see [Installing JIRA applications][1])

For local testing there's an SDK, which starts a JIRA test instance and can be used to develop JIRA Plugins (see [Set up the Atlassian Plugin SDK and Build a Project][2])
