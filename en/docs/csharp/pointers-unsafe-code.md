## Introduction to unsafe code
C# allows using pointer variables in a function of code block when it is marked by the `unsafe` modifier. The unsafe code or the unmanaged code is a code block that uses a pointer variable.

A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable i.e., the direct address of the memory location. similar to any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can use it to store any variable address.

The general form of a pointer declaration is:

    type *var-name;

Following are valid pointer declarations:

    int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
    double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
    float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
    char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */
The following example illustrates use of pointers in C#, using the unsafe modifier:

    using System;
    namespace UnsafeCodeApplication
    {
       class Program
       {
          static unsafe void Main(string[] args)
          {
             int var = 20;
             int* p = &var;
             Console.WriteLine("Data is: {0} ",  var);
             Console.WriteLine("Address is: {0}",  (int)p);
             Console.ReadKey();
          }
       }
    }
When the above code wass compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

    Data is: 20
    Address is: 99215364

Instead of declaring an entire method as unsafe, you can also declare a part of the code as unsafe:

    // safe code
    unsafe
    {
        // you can use pointers here
    }
    // safe code

## Accessing Array Elements Using a Pointer
In C#, an array name and a pointer to a data type same as the array data, are not the same variable type. For example, `int *p` and `int[] p`, are not same type. You can increment the pointer variable `p` because it is not fixed in memory but an array address is fixed in memory, and you can't increment that.

Therefore, if you need to access an array data using a pointer variable, as we traditionally do in C, or C++, you need to fix the pointer using the fixed keyword.

The following example demonstrates this:

    using System;
    namespace UnsafeCodeApplication
    {
       class TestPointer
       {
          public unsafe static void Main()
          {
             int[]  list = {10, 100, 200};
             fixed(int *ptr = list)
             
             /* let us have array address in pointer */
             for ( int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
             {
                Console.WriteLine("Address of list[{0}]={1}",i,(int)(ptr + i));
                Console.WriteLine("Value of list[{0}]={1}", i, *(ptr + i));
             }
             
             Console.ReadKey();
          }
       }
    }

When the above code was compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

    Address of list[0] = 31627168
    Value of list[0] = 10
    Address of list[1] = 31627172
    Value of list[1] = 100
    Address of list[2] = 31627176
    Value of list[2] = 200

## Compiling Unsafe Code
For compiling unsafe code, you have to specify the `/unsafe` command-line switch with command-line compiler.

For example, to compile a program named prog1.cs containing unsafe code, from command line, give the command:

    csc /unsafe prog1.cs

If you are using Visual Studio IDE then you need to enable use of unsafe code in the project properties.

To do this:

 - Open project properties by double clicking the properties node in the
   Solution Explorer.
 - Click on the Build tab.
 - Select the option "Allow
   unsafe code"

## Retrieving the Data Value Using a Pointer
You can retrieve the data stored at the located referenced by the pointer variable, using the ToString() method. The following example demonstrates this:

    using System;
    namespace UnsafeCodeApplication
    {
       class Program
       {
          public static void Main()
          {
             unsafe
             {
                int var = 20;
                int* p = &var;
                Console.WriteLine("Data is: {0} " , var);
                Console.WriteLine("Data is: {0} " , p->ToString());
                Console.WriteLine("Address is: {0} " , (int)p);
             }
             
             Console.ReadKey();
          }
       }
    }
When the above code was compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

    Data is: 20
    Data is: 20
    Address is: 77128984

## Passing Pointers as Parameters to Methods
You can pass a pointer variable to a method as parameter. The following example illustrates this:

    using System;
    namespace UnsafeCodeApplication
    {
       class TestPointer
       {
          public unsafe void swap(int* p, int *q)
          {
             int temp = *p;
             *p = *q;
             *q = temp;
          }
          
          public unsafe static void Main()
          {
             TestPointer p = new TestPointer();
             int var1 = 10;
             int var2 = 20;
             int* x = &var1;
             int* y = &var2;
             
             Console.WriteLine("Before Swap: var1:{0}, var2: {1}", var1, var2);
             p.swap(x, y);
    
             Console.WriteLine("After Swap: var1:{0}, var2: {1}", var1, var2);
             Console.ReadKey();
          }
       }
    }

When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

    Before Swap: var1: 10, var2: 20
    After Swap: var1: 20, var2: 10
