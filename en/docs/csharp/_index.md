C# is a multi-paradigm, C-descendant programming language from Microsoft. C# is a managed language that compiles to [CIL][1], intermediate bytecode which can be executed on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

Versions 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 were standardized by ECMA (as [ECMA-334](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm)), and standardization efforts for modern C# are underway.
