## Syntax
* lock (obj) {}

Using the `lock` statement you can control different threads' access to code within the code block. It is commonly used to prevent race conditions, for example multiple threads reading and removing items from a collection. As locking forces threads to wait for other threads to exit a code block it can cause delays that could be solved with other synchronization methods.

MSDN

> until the object is released.

<hr>

In C# 5.0 and later, the `lock` statement is equivalent to:

    bool lockTaken = false;
    try 
    {
        System.Threading.Monitor.Enter(refObject, ref lockTaken);
        // code 
    }
    finally 
    {
        if (lockTaken)
            System.Threading.Monitor.Exit(refObject);
    }

For C# 4.0 and earlier, the `lock` statement is equivalent to:

    System.Threading.Monitor.Enter(refObject);
    try 
    {
        // code
    }
    finally 
    {
         System.Threading.Monitor.Exit(refObject);
    }

## Throwing exception in a lock statement
Following code will release the lock. There will be no problem. Behind the scenes lock statement works as `try finally`

    lock(locker)
    {
        throw new Exception();
    }

More can be seen in the [C# 5.0 Specification][1]:

A `lock` statement of the form

    lock (x) ...

where `x` is an expression of a *reference-type*, is precisely equivalent to
    
    bool __lockWasTaken = false;
    try {
        System.Threading.Monitor.Enter(x, ref __lockWasTaken);
        ...
    }
    finally {
        if (__lockWasTaken) System.Threading.Monitor.Exit(x);
    }

except that `x` is only evaluated once.

## Simple usage
Common usage of `lock` is a critical section.

In the following example `ReserveRoom` is supposed to be called from different threads. Synchronization with `lock` is the simplest way to prevent race condition here. Method body is surrounded with `lock` which ensures that two or more threads cannot execute it simultaneously. 
 
    public class Hotel
    {
        private readonly object _roomLock = new object();

        public void ReserveRoom(int roomNumber)
        {
            // lock keyword ensures that only one thread executes critical section at once
            // in this case, reserves a hotel room of given number
            // preventing double bookings
            lock (_roomLock)
            {
                // reserve room logic goes here
            }
        }
    }

If a thread reaches `lock`-ed block while another thread is running within it, the former will wait another to exit the block.

## Return in a lock statement
Following code will release lock.

    lock(locker)
    {
        return 5;
    }

## Anti-Patterns and gotchas
# Locking on an stack-allocated / local variable

One of the fallacies while using `lock` is the usage of local objects as locker in a function. Since these local object instances will differ on each call of the function, `lock` will not perform as expected.   

    List<string> stringList = new List<string>();

    public void AddToListNotThreadSafe(string something)
    {
        // DO NOT do this, as each call to this method 
        // will lock on a different instance of an Object.
        // This provides no thread safety, it only degrades performance.
        var localLock = new Object();
        lock(localLock)
        {
            stringList.Add(something);
        }
    }

    // Define object that can be used for thread safety in the AddToList method
    readonly object classLock = new object();

    public void AddToList(List<string> stringList, string something)
    {
        // USE THE classLock instance field to achieve a 
        // thread-safe lock before adding to stringList
        lock(classLock)
        {
            stringList.Add(something);
        }
    }

# Assuming that locking restricts access to the synchronizing object itself

If one thread calls: `lock(obj)` and another thread calls `obj.ToString()` second thread is not going to be blocked.

    object obj = new Object();
     
    public void SomeMethod()
    {
         lock(obj)
        {
           //do dangerous stuff 
        }
     }

     //Meanwhile on other tread 
     public void SomeOtherMethod()
     {
       var objInString = obj.ToString(); //this does not block
     }

# Expecting subclasses to know when to lock

Sometimes base classes are designed such that their subclasses are required to use a lock when accessing certain protected fields:

    public abstract class Base
    {
        protected readonly object padlock;
        protected readonly List<string> list;

        public Base()
        {
            this.padlock = new object();
            this.list = new List<string>();
        }

        public abstract void Do();
    }

    public class Derived1 : Base
    {
        public override void Do()
        {
            lock (this.padlock)
            {
                this.list.Add("Derived1");
            }
        }
    }

    public class Derived2 : Base
    {
        public override void Do()
        {
            this.list.Add("Derived2"); // OOPS! I forgot to lock!
        }
    }

It is much safer to *encapsulate locking* by using a [Template Method][3]:

    public abstract class Base
    {
        private readonly object padlock; // This is now private
        protected readonly List<string> list;

        public Base()
        {
            this.padlock = new object();
            this.list = new List<string>();
        }

        public void Do()
        {
            lock (this.padlock) {
                this.DoInternal();
            }
        }

        protected abstract void DoInternal();
    }

    public class Derived1 : Base
    {
        protected override void DoInternal()
        {
            this.list.Add("Derived1"); // Yay! No need to lock
        }
    }

# Locking on a boxed ValueType variable does not synchronize

In the following example, a private variable is implicitly boxed as it's supplied as an `object` argument to a function, expecting a monitor resource to lock at.
The boxing occurs just prior to calling the IncInSync function, so the boxed instance corresponds to a different heap object each time the function is called.

    public int Count { get; private set; }

    private readonly int counterLock = 1;
    
    public void Inc()
    {
        IncInSync(counterLock);
    }

    private void IncInSync(object monitorResource)
    {
        lock (monitorResource)
        {
            Count++;
        }
    }

Boxing occurs in the `Inc` function:

    BulemicCounter.Inc:
    IL_0000:  nop         
    IL_0001:  ldarg.0     
    IL_0002:  ldarg.0     
    IL_0003:  ldfld       UserQuery+BulemicCounter.counterLock
    IL_0008:  box         System.Int32**
    IL_000D:  call        UserQuery+BulemicCounter.IncInSync
    IL_0012:  nop         
    IL_0013:  ret         

It does not mean that a boxed ValueType can't be used for monitor locking at all:

    private readonly object counterLock = 1;

Now boxing occurs in constructor, which is fine for locking:

    IL_0001:  ldc.i4.1    
    IL_0002:  box         System.Int32
    IL_0007:  stfld       UserQuery+BulemicCounter.counterLock

# Using locks unnecessarily when a safer alternative exists

A very common pattern is to use a private `List` or `Dictionary` in a thread safe class and lock every time it is accessed:

    public class Cache
    {
        private readonly object padlock;
        private readonly Dictionary<string, object> values;

        public WordStats()
        {
            this.padlock = new object();
            this.values = new Dictionary<string, object>();
        }
        
        public void Add(string key, object value)
        {
            lock (this.padlock)
            {
                this.values.Add(key, value);
            }
        }

        /* rest of class omitted */
    }

If there are multiple methods accessing the `values` dictionary, the code can get very long and, more importantly, locking all the time obscures its *intent*. Locking is also very easy to forget and lack of proper locking can cause very hard to find bugs.

By using a [`ConcurrentDictionary`][1], we can avoid locking completely:

    public class Cache
    {
        private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, object> values;

        public WordStats()
        {
            this.values = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, object>();
        }
        
        public void Add(string key, object value)
        {
            this.values.Add(key, value);
        }

        /* rest of class omitted */
    }

Using concurrent collections also improves performance because [all of them employ lock-free techniques][2] to some extent.

## Using instances of Object for lock
When using C#'s inbuilt `lock` statement an instance of some type is needed, but its state does not matter. An instance of `object` is perfect for this:

    public class ThreadSafe {
      private static readonly object locker = new object();


      public void SomeThreadSafeMethod() {
        lock (locker) {
          // Only one thread can be here at a time.
        }
      }
    }

**NB**. instances of `Type` should not be used for this (in the code above `typeof(ThreadSafe)`) because instances of `Type` are shared across AppDomains and thus the extent of the lock can expectedly include code it shouldn't (eg. if `ThreadSafe` is loaded into two AppDomains in the same process then locking on its `Type` instance would mutually lock).
