## Syntax
- checked(a + b)                   // checked expression
- unchecked(a + b)                 // unchecked expression
- checked { c = a + b; c += 5; }   // checked block
- unchecked { c = a + b; c += 5; } // unchecked block

## Checked and Unchecked
C# statements executes in either checked or unchecked context. In a checked context, arithmetic overflow raises an exception. In an unchecked context, arithmetic overflow is ignored and the result is truncated.

    short m = 32767;   
    short n = 32767;
    int result1 =  checked((short)(m + n));   //will throw an OverflowException
    int result2 =  unchecked((short)(m + n)); // will return -2

If neither of these are specified then the default context will rely on other factors, such as compiler options.

## Checked and Unchecked as a scope
The keywords can also create scopes in order to (un)check multiple operations.

    short m = 32767;
    short n = 32767;
    checked
    {
        int result1 = (short)(m + n); //will throw an OverflowException
    }
    unchecked
    {
        int result2 = (short)(m + n); // will return -2
    }
