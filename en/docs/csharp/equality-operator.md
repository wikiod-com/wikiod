## Equality kinds in c# and equality operator
In C#, there are two different kinds of equality: reference equality and value equality. Value equality is the commonly understood meaning of equality: it means that two objects contain the same values. For example, two integers with the value of 2 have value equality. Reference equality means that there are not two objects to compare. Instead, there are two object references, both of which refer to the same object.

    object a = new object();
    object b = a;
    System.Object.ReferenceEquals(a, b);  //returns true

For predefined value types, the equality operator (==) returns true if the values of its operands are equal, false otherwise. For reference types other than string, == returns true if its two operands refer to the same object. For the string type, == compares the values of the strings.
<!-- language: c# -->

    // Numeric equality: True
    Console.WriteLine((2 + 2) == 4);
    
    // Reference equality: different objects, 
    // same boxed value: False.
    object s = 1;
    object t = 1;
    Console.WriteLine(s == t);
    
    // Define some strings:
    string a = "hello";
    string b = String.Copy(a);
    string c = "hello";
    
    // Compare string values of a constant and an instance: True
    Console.WriteLine(a == b);
    
    // Compare string references; 
    // a is a constant but b is an instance: False.
    Console.WriteLine((object)a == (object)b);
    
    // Compare string references, both constants 
    // have the same value, so string interning
    // points to same reference: True.
    Console.WriteLine((object)a == (object)c);
