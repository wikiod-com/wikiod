An iterator is a method, get accessor, or operator that performs a custom iteration over an array or collection class by using the yield keyword

## Creating Iterators Using Yield
Iterators *produce* enumerators. In C#, enumerators are produced by defining methods, properties or indexers that contain `yield` statements. 

Most methods will return control to their caller through normal `return` statements, which disposes all state local to that method. In contrast, methods that use `yield` statements allow them to return multiple values to the caller on request while *preserving* local state in-between returning those values. These returned values constitute a sequence. There are two types of `yield` statements used within iterators:

 - `yield return`, which returns control to the caller but preserves state. The callee will continue execution from this line when control is passed back to it.

 - `yield break`, which functions similarly to a normal `return` statement - this signifies the end of the sequence. Normal `return` statements themselves are illegal within an iterator block.


This example below demonstrates an iterator method that can be used to generate the [Fibonacci sequence][1]:

    IEnumerable<int> Fibonacci(int count)
    {
        int prev = 1;
        int curr = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
            yield return prev;
            int temp = prev + curr;
            prev = curr;
            curr = temp;
        }
    }

This iterator can then be used to produce an enumerator of the Fibonacci sequence that can be consumed by a calling method. The code below demonstrates how the first ten terms within the Fibonacci sequence can be enumerated:

    void Main()
    {
        foreach (int term in Fibonacci(10))
        {
            Console.WriteLine(term);
        }
    }

**Output**

    1
    1
    2
    3
    5
    8
    13
    21
    34
    55

## Simple Numeric Iterator Example

A common use-case for iterators is to perform some operation over a collection of numbers. The example below demonstrates how each element within an array of numbers can be individually printed out to the console.

This is possible because arrays implement the `IEnumerable` interface, allowing clients to obtain an iterator for the array using the `GetEnumerator()` method. This method returns an *enumerator*, which is a read-only, forward-only cursor over each number in the array.

    int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    IEnumerator iterator = numbers.GetEnumerator();

    while (iterator.MoveNext())
    {
        Console.WriteLine(iterator.Current);
    }

**Output**

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5

It's also possible to achieve the same results using a `foreach` statement:

    foreach (int number in numbers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(number);
    }
