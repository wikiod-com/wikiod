There is no inherent answer in C# to this - so called - need. Nonetheless there are workarounds to satisfy this need. 

The reason I qualify the need as "so called" is that we only need methods with 2 or more than 2 values to return when we violate good programming principals. Especially the [Single Responsibility Principle][1]. 

Hence, it would be better to be alerted when we need functions returning 2 or more values, and improve our design.

## "anonymous object" + "dynamic keyword" solution 
You can return an anonymous object from your function

    public static object FunctionWithUnknowReturnValues ()
    {
        /// anonymous object
        return new { a = 1, b = 2 };
    }

And assign the result to a dynamic object and read the values in it.

    /// dynamic object
    dynamic x = FunctionWithUnknowReturnValues();

    Console.WriteLine(x.a);
    Console.WriteLine(x.b);

## Tuple solution
You can return an instance of `Tuple` class from your function with two template parameters as `Tuple<string, MyClass>`:

    public Tuple<string, MyClass> FunctionWith2ReturnValues ()
    {
        return Tuple.Create("abc", new MyClass());
    }

And read the values like below:

    Console.WriteLine(x.Item1);
    Console.WriteLine(x.Item2);

## Ref and Out Parameters
The `ref` keyword is used to pass an [Argument as Reference][1]. `out` will do the same as `ref` but it does not require an assigned value by the caller prior to calling the function. 

**Ref Parameter** :-If you want to pass a variable as ref parameter then you need to initialize it before you pass it as ref parameter to method.

**Out Parameter :-** 
If you want to pass a variable as out parameter you donâ€™t need to initialize it before you pass it as out parameter to method.

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int a = 2;
        int b = 3;
        int add = 0;
        int mult= 0;
        AddOrMult(a, b, ref add, ref mult); //AddOrMult(a, b, out add, out mult);
        Console.WriteLine(add); //5
        Console.WriteLine(mult); //6
    }
    
    private static void AddOrMult(int a, int b, ref int add, ref int mult) //AddOrMult(int a, int b, out int add, out int mult)
    {
        add = a + b;
        mult = a * b;
    }
