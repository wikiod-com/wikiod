## Syntax
- SomeClass sc = new SomeClass { Property1 = value1, Property2 = value2, ... };
- SomeClass sc = new SomeClass(param1, param2, ...) { Property1 = value1, Property2 = value2, ... }

The constructor parentheses can only be omitted if the type being instantiated has a default (parameterless) constructor available.

## Simple usage
Object initializers are handy when you need to create an object and set a couple of properties right away, but the available constructors are not sufficient. Say you have a class

    public class Book
    {
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Author { get; set; }

        // the rest of class definition
    }

To initialize a new instance of the class with an initializer:

    Book theBook = new Book { Title = "Don Quixote", Author = "Miguel de Cervantes" };

This is equivalent to

    Book theBook = new Book();
    theBook.Title = "Don Quixote";
    theBook.Author = "Miguel de Cervantes";

## Usage with non-default constructors
You can combine object initializers with constructors to initialize types if necessary. Take for example a class defined as such:


    public class Book {
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Author { get; set; }
    
        public Book(int id) {
            //do things
        }

        // the rest of class definition
    }

    var someBook = new Book(16) { Title = "Don Quixote", Author = "Miguel de Cervantes" }

This will first instantiate a `Book` with the `Book(int)` constructor, then set each property in the initializer. It is equivalent to:

    var someBook = new Book(16);
    someBook.Title = "Don Quixote";
    someBook.Author = "Miguel de Cervantes";

## Usage with anonymous types
Object initializers are the only way to initialize anonymous types, which are types generated by the compiler.

    var album = new { Band = "Beatles", Title = "Abbey Road" };

For that reason object initializers are widely used in LINQ select queries, since they provide a convenient way to specify which parts of a queried object you are interested in.

    var albumTitles = from a in albums 
                      select new 
                      { 
                         Title = a.Title, 
                         Artist = a.Band 
                      };
