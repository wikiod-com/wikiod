Each implementation of `Equals` must fulfil the following requirements:

 - **Reflexive**: An object must equal itself.<br/>`x.Equals(x)` returns `true`.

 - **Symmetric**: There is no difference if I compare x to y or y to x - the result is the same. <br/>`x.Equals(y)` returns the same value as `y.Equals(x)`.

 - **Transitive**: If one object is equal to another object and this one is equal to a third one, the first has to be equal to the third.<br/>if `(x.Equals(y) && y.Equals(z))` returns `true`, then `x.Equals(z)` returns `true`.

 - **Consistent**: If you compare an object to another multiple times, the result is always the same.<br/>Successive invocations of `x.Equals(y)` return the same value as long as the objects referenced by x and y are not modified.

 - **Comparison to null**: No object is equal to `null`.<br/>`x.Equals(null)` returns `false`.

Implementations of `GetHashCode`:

 - **Compatible with `Equals`**: If two objects are equal (meaning that `Equals` returns true), then `GetHashCode` **must** return the same value for each of them.

 - **Large range**: If two objects are not equal (`Equals` says false), there should be a **high probability** their hash codes are distinct. *Perfect* hashing is often not possible as there is a limited number of values to choose from.

 - **Cheap**: It should be inexpensive to calculate the hash code in all cases.

## Writing a good GetHashCode override
`GetHashCode` has major performance effects on Dictionary<> and HashTable.

Good `GetHashCode` Methods

 - should have an even distribution
   - every integer should have a roughly equal chance of returning for a random instance
   - if your method returns the same integer (e.g. the constant '999') for each instance, you'll have bad performance
 - should be quick
   - These are NOT cryptographic hashes, where slowness is a feature
   - the slower your hash function, the slower your dictionary
 - must return the same HashCode on two instances that `Equals` evaluates to true
   - if they do not (e.g. because `GetHashCode` returns a random number), items may not be found in a `List`, `Dictionary`, or similar.

A good method to implement `GetHashCode` is to use one prime number as a starting value, and add the hashcodes of the fields of the type multiplied by other prime numbers to that:

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        unchecked // Overflow is fine, just wrap
        {
            int hash = 3049; // Start value (prime number).

            // Suitable nullity checks etc, of course :)
            hash = hash * 5039 + field1.GetHashCode();
            hash = hash * 883 + field2.GetHashCode();
            hash = hash * 9719 + field3.GetHashCode();
            return hash;
        }
    }

Only the fields which are used in the `Equals`-method should be used for the hash function.

If you have a need to treat the same type in different ways for Dictionary/HashTables, you can use IEqualityComparer<T>. 

## Default Equals behavior.
`Equals` is declared in the `Object` class itself.

    public virtual bool Equals(Object obj);

By default, `Equals` has the following behavior:

 - If the instance is a reference type, then `Equals` will return true only if the references are the same.

- If the instance is a value type, then `Equals` will return true only if the type and value are the same.

- `string` is a special case. It behaves like a value type.


    namespace ConsoleApplication
    {
        public class Program
        {
            public static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                //areFooClassEqual: False
                Foo fooClass1 = new Foo("42");
                Foo fooClass2 = new Foo("42");
                bool areFooClassEqual = fooClass1.Equals(fooClass2);
                Console.WriteLine("fooClass1 and fooClass2 are equal: {0}", areFooClassEqual);
                //False
    
                //areFooIntEqual: True
                int fooInt1 = 42;
                int fooInt2 = 42;
                bool areFooIntEqual = fooInt1.Equals(fooInt2);
                Console.WriteLine("fooInt1 and fooInt2 are equal: {0}", areFooIntEqual);
    
                //areFooStringEqual: True
                string fooString1 = "42";
                string fooString2 = "42";
                bool areFooStringEqual = fooString1.Equals(fooString2);
                Console.WriteLine("fooString1 and fooString2 are equal: {0}", areFooStringEqual);
            }
        }
    
        public class Foo
        {
            public string Bar { get; }
    
            public Foo(string bar)
            {
                Bar = bar;
            }
        }
    }

## Override Equals and GetHashCode on custom types
For a class `Person` like:

    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public string Clothes { get; set; }
    }
    
    var person1 = new Person { Name = "Jon", Age = 20, Clothes = "some clothes" };
    var person2 = new Person { Name = "Jon", Age = 20, Clothes = "some other clothes" };

    bool result = person1.Equals(person2); //false because it's reference Equals

But defining `Equals` and `GetHashCode` as follows:

    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public string Clothes { get; set; }

        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            var person = obj as Person;
            if(person == null) return false;
            return Name == person.Name && Age == person.Age; //the clothes are not important when comparing two persons
        }

        public override int GetHashCode()
        {
            return Name.GetHashCode()*Age;
        }
    }

    var person1 = new Person { Name = "Jon", Age = 20, Clothes = "some clothes" };
    var person2 = new Person { Name = "Jon", Age = 20, Clothes = "some other clothes" };
    
    bool result = person1.Equals(person2); // result is true

Also using LINQ to make different queries on persons will check both `Equals` and `GetHashCode`:

    var persons = new List<Person>
    {
         new Person{ Name = "Jon", Age = 20, Clothes = "some clothes"},
         new Person{ Name = "Dave", Age = 20, Clothes = "some other clothes"},
         new Person{ Name = "Jon", Age = 20, Clothes = ""}
    };

    var distinctPersons = persons.Distinct().ToList();//distinctPersons has Count = 2

## Equals and GetHashCode in IEqualityComparator
For given type `Person`:

    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public string Clothes { get; set; }
    }

    List<Person> persons = new List<Person>
    {
        new Person{ Name = "Jon", Age = 20, Clothes = "some clothes"},
        new Person{ Name = "Dave", Age = 20, Clothes = "some other clothes"},
        new Person{ Name = "Jon", Age = 20, Clothes = ""}
    };

    var distinctPersons = persons.Distinct().ToList();// distinctPersons has Count = 3

But defining `Equals` and `GetHashCode` into an `IEqualityComparator` :

    public class PersonComparator : IEqualityComparer<Person>
    {
        public bool Equals(Person x, Person y)
        {
            return x.Name == y.Name && x.Age == y.Age; //the clothes are not important when comparing two persons;
        }

        public int GetHashCode(Person obj) { return obj.Name.GetHashCode() * obj.Age; }
    }

    var distinctPersons = persons.Distinct(new PersonComparator()).ToList();// distinctPersons has Count = 2

Note that for this query, two objects have been considered equal if both the `Equals` returned true and the `GetHashCode` have returned the same hash code for the two persons.
