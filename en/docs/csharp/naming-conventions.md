This topic outlines some basic naming conventions used when writing in the C# language. Like all conventions, they are not enforced by the compiler, but will ensure readability between developers.

For comprehensive .NET framework design guidelines, see [docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/).

## Choose easily readable identifier names
For example, a property named HorizontalAlignment is more readable in English than AlignmentHorizontal.

## Favor readability over brevity
The property name `CanScrollHorizontally` is better than `ScrollableX` (an obscure reference to the X-axis).

Avoid using underscores, hyphens, or any other non-alphanumeric characters.

## Do **not** use Hungarian notation
Hungarian notation is the practice of including a prefix in identifiers to encode some metadata about the parameter, such as the data type of the identifier, e.g. `string strName`.

Also, avoid using identifiers that conflict with keywords already used within C#.

## Abbreviations and acronyms
In general, you should not use abbreviations or acronyms; these make your names less readable. Similarly, it is difficult to know when it is safe to assume that an acronym is widely recognized.

## Capitalization conventions
The following terms describe different ways to case identifiers.
## Pascal Casing
The first letter in the identifier and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word are capitalized. You can use Pascal case for identifiers of three or more characters. For example: `BackColor`

## Camel Casing
The first letter of an identifier is lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word is capitalized. For example: `backColor`

## Uppercase
All letters in the identifier are capitalized. For example: `IO`

## Rules
When an identifier consists of multiple words, do not use separators, such as underscores ("_") or hyphens ("-"), between words. Instead, use casing to indicate the beginning of each word.

The following table summarizes the capitalization rules for identifiers and provides examples for the different types of identifiers:

Identifier             | Case   | Example
---------------------- | ------ | -------
Local variable         | Camel  | carName
Class                  | Pascal | AppDomain
Enumeration type       | Pascal | ErrorLevel
Enumeration values     | Pascal | FatalError
Event                  | Pascal | ValueChanged
Exception class        | Pascal | WebException
Read-only static field | Pascal | RedValue
Interface              | Pascal | IDisposable
Method                 | Pascal | ToString
Namespace              | Pascal | System.Drawing
Parameter              | Camel  | typeName
Property               | Pascal | BackColor

## Enums
## Use a singular name for most Enums

    public enum Volume
    {
       Low,
       Medium,
       High
    }

## Use a plural name for Enum types that are bit fields

    [Flags]
    public enum MyColors
    {
        Yellow = 1,
        Green = 2,
        Red = 4,
        Blue = 8
    }
*Note: Always add the [`FlagsAttribute`][1] to a bit field Enum type.*

## Do **not** add 'enum' as a suffix

    public enum VolumeEnum // Incorrect

## Do **not** use the enum name in each entry

    public enum Color
    {
        ColorBlue, // Remove Color, unnecessary
        ColorGreen,
    }

## Interfaces
Interfaces should be named with nouns or noun phrases, or adjectives that describe behaviour. For example `IComponent` uses a descriptive noun, `ICustomAttributeProvider` uses a noun phrase and `IPersistable` uses an adjective.

Interface names should be prefixed with the letter `I`, to indicate that the type is an interface, and Pascal case should be used.

Below are correctly named interfaces:

    public interface IServiceProvider
    public interface IFormatable

## Exceptions
## Add 'exception' as a suffix
Custom exception names should be suffixed with "-Exception".

Below are correctly named exceptions:

    public class MyCustomException : Exception
    public class FooException : Exception

## Private fields
There are two common conventions for private fields: `camelCase` and `_camelCaseWithLeadingUnderscore`.

## Camel case

    public class Rational
    {
        private readonly int numerator;
        private readonly int denominator;

        public Rational(int numerator, int denominator)
        {
            // "this" keyword is required to refer to the class-scope field
            this.numerator = numerator;
            this.denominator = denominator;
        }
    }

## Camel case with underscore

    public class Rational
    {
        private readonly int _numerator;
        private readonly int _denominator;

        public Rational(int numerator, int denominator)
        {
            // Names are unique, so "this" keyword is not required
            _numerator = numerator;
            _denominator = denominator;
        }
    }

## Namespaces
The general format for namespaces is:

    <Company>.(<Product>|<Technology>)[.<Feature>][.<Subnamespace>].

Examples include:

    Fabrikam.Math
    Litware.Security

Prefixing namespace names with a company name prevents namespaces from different companies from having the same name.
