Unlike classes, a `struct` is a value type, and is created on the local stack and not on the managed heap, *by default*. This means that once the specific stack goes out of scope, the `struct` is de-allocated. Contained reference types of de-allocated `struct`s are also swept, once the GC determines they are not longer referenced to by the `struct`.

`struct`s cannot inherit and cannot be bases for inheritance, they are implicitly sealed, and also cannot include `protected` members. However, a `struct` can implement an interface, as classes do. 

## Declaring a struct
    public struct Vector 
    {
        public int X;
        public int Y;
        public int Z;
    }

    public struct Point
    {
        public decimal x, y;
        
        public Point(decimal pointX, decimal pointY)
        {
            x = pointX;
            y = pointY;
        }
    }

 - `struct` instance fields can be set via a parametrized constructor or individually after `struct` construction.
 - Private members can only be initialized by the constructor.
 - `struct` defines a sealed type that implicitly inherits from System.ValueType.  
 - Structs cannot inherit from any other type, but they can implement interfaces.
 - Structs are copied on assignment, meaning all data is copied to the new instance and changes to one of them are not reflected by the other. 
 - A struct cannot be `null`, although it *can* used as a nullable type:

       Vector v1 = null; //illegal
       Vector? v2 = null; //OK
       Nullable<Vector> v3 = null // OK

 - Structs can be instantiated with or without using the `new` operator.

       //Both of these are acceptable
       Vector v1 = new Vector();
       v1.X = 1;
       v1.Y = 2;
       v1.Z = 3;
    
       Vector v2;
       v2.X = 1;
       v2.Y = 2;
       v2.Z = 3;

    However, the `new` operator must be used in order to use an initializer:

       Vector v1 = new MyStruct { X=1, Y=2, Z=3 }; // OK
       Vector v2 { X=1, Y=2, Z=3 }; // illegal

A struct can declare everything a class can declare, with a few exceptions:  
 - A struct cannot declare a parameterless constructor. `struct` instance fields can be set via a parameterized constructor or individually after `struct` construction. Private members can only be initialized by the constructor.
 - A struct cannot declare members as protected, since it is implicitly sealed. 
 - Struct fields can only be initialized if they are const or static.

## Struct usage
**With constructor:**  

    Vector v1 = new Vector();
    v1.X = 1;
    v1.Y = 2;
    v1.Z = 3;
    
    Console.WriteLine("X = {0}, Y = {1}, Z = {2}",v1.X,v1.Y,v1.Z);
    // Output X=1,Y=2,Z=3

    Vector v1 = new Vector();
    //v1.X is not assigned
    v1.Y = 2;
    v1.Z = 3;
    
    Console.WriteLine("X = {0}, Y = {1}, Z = {2}",v1.X,v1.Y,v1.Z);
    // Output X=0,Y=2,Z=3

    Point point1 = new Point();
    point1.x = 0.5;
    point1.y = 0.6;
    
    Point point2 = new Point(0.5, 0.6);

**Without constructor:**

    Vector v1;
    v1.Y = 2;
    v1.Z = 3;
    
    Console.WriteLine("X = {0}, Y = {1}, Z = {2}",v1.X,v1.Y,v1.Z);
    //Output ERROR "Use of possibly unassigned field 'X'

    Vector v1;
    v1.X = 1;
    v1.Y = 2;
    v1.Z = 3;
    
    Console.WriteLine("X = {0}, Y = {1}, Z = {2}",v1.X,v1.Y,v1.Z);
    // Output X=1,Y=2,Z=3

    Point point3;
    point3.x = 0.5;
    point3.y = 0.6;

If we use a struct with its constructor, we aren't going to have problems with unassigned field (each unassigned field has null value).

Unlike classes, a struct doesn't have to be constructed, i.e. there is no need to use the new keyword, unless you need to call one of the constructors. A struct does not require the new keyword because is a value-type and thus cannot be null.

## Struct implementing interface
    public interface IShape
    {
        decimal Area();
    }
    
    public struct Rectangle : IShape
    {
        public decimal Length { get; set; }
        public decimal Width { get; set; }
    
        public decimal Area()
        {
            return Length * Width;
        }
    }

## Structs are copied on assignment
Sinse structs are value types all the data is _copied_ on assignment, and any modification to the new copy does not change the data for the original copy. The code snippet below shows that `p1` is _copied_ to `p2` and changes made on `p1` does not affect `p2` instance.

    var p1 = new Point {
        x = 1,
        y = 2
    };
    
    Console.WriteLine($"{p1.x} {p1.y}"); // 1 2
    
    var p2 = p1;
    Console.WriteLine($"{p2.x} {p2.y}"); // Same output: 1 2
    
    p1.x = 3;
    Console.WriteLine($"{p1.x} {p1.y}"); // 3 2
    Console.WriteLine($"{p2.x} {p2.y}"); // p2 remain the same: 1 2
