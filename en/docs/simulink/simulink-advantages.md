Most of the system models available in Simulink can be implemented using m-files but there are there are some core differences that people prefer to use Simulink. Here we will list som of the advantages of Simulink over m-file simulation.
1- Simulink is Similar to hardware implementation. 
2- Simulink is very easy to read as it is like a block diagram that also works.
3- Simulation is done over time so state of the whole system in each time-slot is available.

This is a simple Simulink model where we can easily generate a signal and connect it to the scope. As this example shows anyone without knowledge of programming can easily work with the model, change its parameters and see the effect on the output.
