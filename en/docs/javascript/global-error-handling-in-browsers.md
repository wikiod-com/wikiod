## Syntax
- window.onerror = function (eventOrMessage, url, lineNumber, colNumber, error) { ... }

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| ---- | --- |
| eventOrMessage | Some browsers will call the event handler with just one argument, an `Event` object. However, other browsers, especially the older ones and older mobile ones will supply a `String` message as a first argument. |
| url | If a handler is called with more than 1 argument, the second argument usually is an URL of a JavaScript file that is the source of the problem. |
| lineNumber | If a handler is called with more than 1 argument, the third argument is a line number inside the JavaScript source file. |
| colNumber | If a handler is called with more than 1 argument, the fourth argument is the column number inside the JavaScript source file. |
| error | If a handler is called with more than 1 argument, the fifth argument is sometimes an `Error` object describing the problem. |

Unfortunately, `window.onerror` has historically been implemented differently by each vendor. The information provided in the **Parameters** section is an approximation of what to expect across different browsers and their versions.

## Handling window.onerror to report all errors back to the server-side
The following example listens to `window.onerror` event and uses an image beacon technique to send the information through the GET parameters of an URL.

    var hasLoggedOnce = false;
    
    // Some browsers (at least Firefox) don't report line and column numbers
    // when event is handled through window.addEventListener('error', fn). That's why
    // a more reliable approach is to set an event listener via direct assignment.
    window.onerror = function (eventOrMessage, url, lineNumber, colNumber, error) {
        if (hasLoggedOnce || !eventOrMessage) {
            // It does not make sense to report an error if:
            // 1. another one has already been reported -- the page has an invalid state and may produce way too many errors.
            // 2. the provided information does not make sense (!eventOrMessage -- the browser didn't supply information for some reason.)
            return;
        }
        hasLoggedOnce = true;
        if (typeof eventOrMessage !== 'string') {
            error = eventOrMessage.error;
            url = eventOrMessage.filename || eventOrMessage.fileName;
            lineNumber = eventOrMessage.lineno || eventOrMessage.lineNumber;
            colNumber = eventOrMessage.colno || eventOrMessage.columnNumber;
            eventOrMessage = eventOrMessage.message || eventOrMessage.name || error.message || error.name;
        }
        if (error && error.stack) {
            eventOrMessage = [eventOrMessage, '; Stack: ', error.stack, '.'].join('');
        }
        var jsFile = (/[^/]+\.js/i.exec(url || '') || [])[0] || 'inlineScriptOrDynamicEvalCode',
            stack = [eventOrMessage, ' Occurred in ', jsFile, ':', lineNumber || '?', ':', colNumber || '?'].join('');
    
        // shortening the message a bit so that it is more likely to fit into browser's URL length limit (which is 2,083 in some browsers)
        stack = stack.replace(/https?\:\/\/[^/]+/gi, '');
        // calling the server-side handler which should probably register the error in a database or a log file
        new Image().src = '/exampleErrorReporting?stack=' + encodeURIComponent(stack);
        
        // window.DEBUG_ENVIRONMENT a configurable property that may be set to true somewhere else for debugging and testing purposes.
        if (window.DEBUG_ENVIRONMENT) {
            alert('Client-side script failed: ' + stack);
        }
    }
