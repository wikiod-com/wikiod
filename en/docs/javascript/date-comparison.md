## Comparing Date values
To check the equality of `Date` values:

    var date1 = new Date();
    var date2 = new Date(date1.valueOf() + 10);
    console.log(date1.valueOf() === date2.valueOf());

> Sample output: `false`

Note that you must use `valueOf()` or `getTime()` to compare the values of `Date` objects because the equality operator will compare if two object references are the same. For example:

    var date1 = new Date();
    var date2 = new Date();
    console.log(date1 === date2);

> Sample output: `false`

Whereas if the variables point to the same object:

    var date1 = new Date();
    var date2 = date1;
    console.log(date1 === date2);

> Sample output: `true`

However, the other comparison operators will work as usual and you can use `<` and `>` to compare that one date is earlier or later than the other. For example:

    var date1 = new Date();
    var date2 = new Date(date1.valueOf() + 10);
    console.log(date1 < date2);

> Sample output: `true`

It works even if the operator includes equality:

    var date1 = new Date();
    var date2 = new Date(date1.valueOf());
    console.log(date1 <= date2);

> Sample output: `true`

## Date Difference Calculation
To compare the difference of two dates, we can do the comparison based on the timestamp.

    var date1 = new Date();
    var date2 = new Date(date1.valueOf() + 5000);
    
    var dateDiff = date1.valueOf() - date2.valueOf();
    var dateDiffInYears = dateDiff/1000/60/60/24/365; //convert milliseconds into years
    
    console.log("Date difference in years : " + dateDiffInYears);
