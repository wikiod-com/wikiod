# Transactions

Transactions need to be used immediately after they're created. If they aren't used in the current event loop (basically before we wait for anything like a web request) they'll go into an inactive state where you can't use them.

Databases can only have one transaction that writes to a particular object store at a time. So you can have as many as you want that read from our `things` store, but only one can make changes at any given time.

## Opening a database
Opening a database is an asynchronous operation. We need to send a request to open our database and then listen for events so we know when it's ready.

We'll open a DemoDB database. If it doesn't exist yet, it will get created when we send the request.

The `2` below says that we're asking for version 2 of our database. Only one version
exists at any time, but we can use the version number to upgrade old data, as you'll see.

    var db = null, // We'll use this once we have our database
        request = window.indexedDB.open("DemoDB", 2);

    // Listen for success. This will be called after onupgradeneeded runs, if it does at all
    request.onsuccess = function() {
        db = request.result; // We have a database!

        doThingsWithDB(db);
    };

    // If our database didn't exist before, or it was an older version than what we requested,
    // the `onupgradeneeded` event will be fired.
    // 
    // We can use this to setup a new database and upgrade an old one with new data stores
    request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
        db = request.result;

        // If the oldVersion is less than 1, then the database didn't exist. Let's set it up
        if (event.oldVersion < 1) {
            // We'll create a new "things" store with `autoIncrement`ing keys
            var store = db.createObjectStore("things", { autoIncrement: true });
        }

        // In version 2 of our database, we added a new index by the name of each thing
        if (event.oldVersion < 2) {
            // Let's load the things store and create an index
            var store = request.transaction.objectStore("things");

            store.createIndex("by_name", "name");
        }
    };

    // Handle any errors
    request.onerror = function() {
        console.error("Something went wrong when we tried to request the database!");
    };

## Testing for IndexedDB availability
You can test for IndexedDB support in the current environment by checking for the presence of the `window.indexedDB` property:

    if (window.indexedDB) {
        // IndexedDB is available
    }

## Adding objects
Anything that needs to happen with data in an IndexedDB database happens in a transaction. There are a few things to note about transactions that are mentioned in the Remarks section at the bottom of this page.

We'll use the database we set up in **Opening a database.**


    // Create a new readwrite (since we want to change things) transaction for the things store
    var transaction = db.transaction(["things"], "readwrite");

    // Transactions use events, just like database open requests. Let's listen for success
    transaction.oncomplete = function() {
        console.log("All done!");
    };

    // And make sure we handle errors
    transaction.onerror = function() {
        console.log("Something went wrong with our transaction: ", transaction.error);
    };

    // Now that our event handlers are set up, let's get our things store and add some objects!
    var store = transaction.objectStore("things");


    // Transactions can do a few things at a time. Let's start with a simple insertion
    var request = store.add({
        // "things" uses auto-incrementing keys, so we don't need one, but we can set it anyway
        key: "coffee_cup",
        name: "Coffee Cup",
        contents: ["coffee", "cream"]
    });

    // Let's listen so we can see if everything went well
    request.onsuccess = function(event) {
        // Done! Here, `request.result` will be the object's key, "coffee_cup"
    };


    // We can also add a bunch of things from an array. We'll use auto-generated keys
    var thingsToAdd = [{ name: "Example object" }, { value: "I don't have a name" }];

    // Let's use more compact code this time and ignore the results of our insertions
    thingsToAdd.forEach(e => store.add(e));

## Retrieving data
Anything that needs to happen with data in an IndexedDB database happens in a transaction. There are a few things to note about transactions that are mentioned in the Remarks section at the bottom of this page.

We'll use the database we set up in Opening a database.

    // Create a new transaction, we'll use the default "readonly" mode and the things store
    var transaction = db.transaction(["things"]);

    // Transactions use events, just like database open requests. Let's listen for success
    transaction.oncomplete = function() {
        console.log("All done!");
    };

    // And make sure we handle errors
    transaction.onerror = function() {
        console.log("Something went wrong with our transaction: ", transaction.error);
    };

    // Now that everything is set up, let's get our things store and load some objects!
    var store = transaction.objectStore("things");


    // We'll load the coffee_cup object we added in Adding objects
    var request = store.get("coffee_cup");

    // Let's listen so we can see if everything went well
    request.onsuccess = function(event) {
        // All done, let's log our object to the console
        console.log(request.result);
    };


    // That was pretty long for a basic retrieval. If we just want to get just
    // the one object and don't care about errors, we can shorten things a lot
    db.transaction("things").objectStore("things")
        .get("coffee_cup").onsuccess = e => console.log(e.target.result);
