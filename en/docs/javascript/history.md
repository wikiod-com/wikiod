The HTML5 History API is not implemented by all browsers and implementations tend to differ between browser vendors. It is currently supported by the following browsers:

- Firefox 4+
- Google Chrome
- Internet Explorer 10+
- Safari 5+
- iOS 4

If you want to find out more about the History API implementations and methods, please refer to [the state of the HTML5 History API][1].

## history.pushState()
Syntax :

    history.pushState(state object, title, url)

This method allows to ADD histories entries. For more reference, Please have a look on this document : [pushState() method][1] 

**Example :**

    window.history.pushState("http://example.ca", "Sample Title", "/example/path.html");

This example inserts a new record into the history, address bar, and page title. 

Note this is different from the `history.replaceState()`. Which updates the current history entry, rather than adding a new one.

## history.replaceState()
**Syntax :**

    history.replaceState(data, title [, url ])

This method modifies the current history entry instead of creating a new one. Mainly used when we want to update URL of the current history entry.

    window.history.replaceState("http://example.ca", "Sample Title", "/example/path.html");

This example replaces the current history, address bar, and page title. 

Note this is different from the `history.pushState()`. Which inserts a new history entry, rather than replacing the current one.

## Load a specific URL from the history list
**go() method** 

The go() method loads a specific URL from the history list.
The parameter can either be a number which goes to the URL within the specific position (-1 goes back one page, 1 goes forward one page), or a string. The string must be a partial or full URL, and the function will go to the first URL that matches the string.

> Syntax

    history.go(number|URL)

> Example

Click on the button to go back two pages:

    <html>
        <head>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            function goBack()
            {
                window.history.go(-2)
            }
        </script>
        </head>
        <body>    
            <input type="button" value="Go back 2 pages" onclick="goBack()" />    
        </body>
    </html>
