JavaScript (not to be confused with [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))) is a dynamic, weakly-typed language used for client-side as well as server-side scripting. 

JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.  This means the language considers capital letters to be different from their lowercase counterparts.  Keywords in JavaScript are all lowercase.

JavaScript is a commonly referenced implementation of ECMAScript standard.

Topics in this tag often refer to the use of JavaScript within the browser, unless otherwise stated. JavaScript files alone can't be run directly by the browser; it's necessary to embed them in an HTML document. If you have some JavaScript code you'd like to try, you can embed it in some placeholder content like this, and save the result as `example.html`:

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Test page</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        Inline script (option 1):
        <script>
          // YOUR CODE HERE
        </script>
        External script (option 2):
        <script src="your-code-file.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
