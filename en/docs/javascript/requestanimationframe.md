## Syntax
- window.requestAnimationFrame(*callback*);
- window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame(*callback*);
- window.mozRequestAnimationFrame(*callback*);

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| --------- | ------- |
| callback | "A parameter specifying a function to call when it's time to update your animation for the next repaint." (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) |

When it comes to animating DOM elements fluidly, we are limited to the following CSS transitions:

- POSITION - `transform: translate (npx, npx);`
- SCALE - `transform: scale(n)`;
- ROTATION - `transform: rotate(ndeg);`
- OPACITY - `opacity: 0;`

However, using these is no guarantee that your animations will be fluid, because it causes the browser to start new `paint` cycles, regardless of what else is going on. Basically, `paint` are made inefficiently and your animation looks "janky" because the frames per second (FPS) suffers.

**To guarantee smooth-as-possible DOM animations, requestAnimationFrame must be used in conjunction with the above CSS transitions.**

The reason this works, is because the `requestAnimationFrame` API lets the browser know that you want an animation to happen at the next `paint` cycle, **as opposed to interrupting what's going on to force a new paint cycle in when a non-RAF animation is called**.

## Use requestAnimationFrame to fade in element
- **View jsFiddle**: https://jsfiddle.net/HimmatChahal/jb5trg67/
- **Copy + Pasteable code below**: 


    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>This will fade in at 60 frames per second (or as close to possible as your hardware allows)</h1>
            
            <script>
                // Fade in over 2000 ms = 2 seconds.
                var FADE_DURATION = 2.0 * 1000; 
                
                // -1 is simply a flag to indicate if we are rendering the very 1st frame
                var startTime=-1.0; 
                
                // Function to render current frame (whatever frame that may be)
                function render(currTime) { 
                    var head1 = document.getElementsByTagName('h1')[0]; 
                
                    // How opaque should head1 be?  Its fade started at currTime=0.
                    // Over FADE_DURATION ms, opacity goes from 0 to 1
                    var opacity = (currTime/FADE_DURATION);
                    head1.style.opacity = opacity;
                }
                
                // Function to 
                function eachFrame() {
                    // Time that animation has been running (in ms)
                    // Uncomment the console.log function to view how quickly 
                    // the timeRunning updates its value (may affect performance)
                    var timeRunning = (new Date()).getTime() - startTime;
                    //console.log('var timeRunning = '+timeRunning+'ms');
                    if (startTime < 0) {
                        // This branch: executes for the first frame only.
                        // it sets the startTime, then renders at currTime = 0.0
                        startTime = (new Date()).getTime();
                        render(0.0);
                    } else if (timeRunning < FADE_DURATION) {
                        // This branch: renders every frame, other than the 1st frame,
                        // with the new timeRunning value.
                        render(timeRunning);
                    } else {
                        return;
                    }
                
                    // Now we're done rendering one frame.
                    // So we make a request to the browser to execute the next
                    // animation frame, and the browser optimizes the rest.
                    // This happens very rapidly, as you can see in the console.log();
                    window.requestAnimationFrame(eachFrame);
                };
                
                // start the animation
                window.requestAnimationFrame(eachFrame);    
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>

## Cancelling an Animation
To cancel a call to `requestAnimationFrame`, you need the id it returned from when it was last called.  This is the parameter you use for `cancelAnimationFrame`.  The following example starts some hypothetical animation then pauses it after one second.

    // stores the id returned from each call to requestAnimationFrame
    var requestId;
    
    // draw something
    function draw(timestamp) {
        // do some animation
        // request next frame
        start();
    }
    
    // pauses the animation
    function pause() {
        // pass in the id returned from the last call to requestAnimationFrame
        cancelAnimationFrame(requestId);
    }
    
    // begin the animation
    function start() {
        // store the id returned from requestAnimationFrame
        requestId = requestAnimationFrame(draw);
    }
    
    // begin now
    start();
    
    // after a second, pause the animation
    setTimeout(pause,1000);

## Keeping Compatability
Of course, just like most things in browser JavaScript, you just can't count on the fact that everything will be the same everywhere. In this case, `requestAnimationFrame` might have a prefix on some platforms and are named differently, such as `webkitRequestAnimationFrame`. Fortunately, there's a really easy way to group all the known differences that could exist down to 1 function:

    window.requestAnimationFrame = (function(){
        return window.requestAnimationFrame ||
            window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||
            window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ||
            function(callback){
                window.setTimeout(callback, 1000 / 60);
            };
    })();

Note that the last option (which fills in when no existing support was found) will not return an id to be used in `cancelAnimationFrame`. There is, however an [efficient polyfill](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671) that was written which fixes this.
