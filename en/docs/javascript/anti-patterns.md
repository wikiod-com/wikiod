## Chaining assignments in var declarations.
Chaining assignments as part of a `var` declaration will create global variables unintentionally.

For example:

    (function foo() {    
        var a = b = 0;
    })()
    console.log('a: ' + a);
    console.log('b: ' + b);

Will result in:

<!-- language: lang-none -->

    Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
    'b: 0'

In the above example, `a` is local but `b` becomes global. This is because of the right to left evaluation of the `=` operator. So the above code actually evaluated as

    var a = (b = 0);

The correct way to chain var assignments is:

    var a, b;
    a = b = 0;

Or: 

    var a = 0, b = a;

This will make sure that both `a` and `b` will be local variables.
