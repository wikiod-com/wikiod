In JavaScript, the `eval` function evaluates a string as if it were JavaScript code. The return value is the result of the evaluated string, e.g. `eval('2 + 2')` returns `4`.

`eval` is available in the global scope. The lexical scope of the evaluation is the local scope unless invoked indirectly (e.g. `var geval = eval; geval(s);`).

**The use of `eval` is strongly discouraged.** See the [Remarks section](#remarks) for details.

## Syntax
- eval(string);

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| --- | ---|
| string | The JavaScript to be evaluated. |




**The use of `eval` is strongly discouraged; in many scenarios it presents a security vulnerability.**

>eval() is a dangerous function, which executes the code it's passed with the privileges of the caller. If you run eval() with a string that could be affected by a malicious party, you may end up running malicious code on the user's machine with the permissions of your webpage / extension. More importantly, third party code can see the scope in which eval() was invoked, which can lead to possible attacks in ways to which the similar Function is not susceptible.

## Introduction
You can always run JavaScript from inside itself, although this is **strongly discouraged** due to the security vulnerabilities it presents (see [Remarks](#remarks) for details).

To run JavaScript from inside JavaScript, simply use the below function:

    eval("var a = 'Hello, World!'");



## Evaluation and Math
You can set a variable to something with the `eval()` function by using something similar to the below code:

    var x = 10;
    var y = 20;
    var a = eval("x * y") + "<br>";
    var b = eval("2 + 2") + "<br>";
    var c = eval("x + 17") + "<br>";
    
    var res = a + b + c;

The result, stored in the variable `res`, will be:

> 200<br>4<br>27

**The use of `eval` is strongly discouraged.** See the [Remarks section](#remarks) for details.

## Evaluate a string of JavaScript statements


    var x = 5;
    var str = "if (x == 5) {console.log('z is 42'); z = 42;} else z = 0; ";

    console.log("z is ", eval(str));
