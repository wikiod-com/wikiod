Variables are what make up most of JavaScript. These variables make up things from numbers to objects, which are all over JavaScript to make one's life much easier.

## Syntax
- var {variable_name} [= {value}];

## Parameters
| variable_name | **{Required}** The name of the variable: used when calling it. |
| ------ | ------ |
| =   |  **[Optional]** Assignment (defining the variable) |
| value | **{Required when using Assignment}** The value of a variable **[default: undefined]** |

    "use strict";
#
    'use strict';

**Strict Mode** makes JavaScript stricter to assure you the best habits. For example, assigning a variable:

    "use strict"; // or 'use strict';
    var syntax101 = "var is used when assigning a variable.";
    uhOh = "This is an error!";
`uhOh` is supposed to be defined using `var`. Strict Mode, being on, shows an error (in the Console, it doesn't care). Use this to generate good habits on defining variables.

You may use **Nested Arrays and Objects** some time. They are sometimes useful, and they're also fun to work with. Here is how they work:    

Nested Arrays
---

    var myArray = [ "The following is an array", ["I'm an array"] ];
#
    console.log(myArray[1]); // (1) ["I'm an array"]
    console.log(myArray[1][0]); // "I'm an array"
#
    var myGraph = [ [0, 0], [5, 10], [3, 12] ]; // useful nested array
#
    console.log(myGraph[0]); // [0, 0]
    console.log(myGraph[1][1]); // 10

Nested Objects
---

    var myObject = {
        firstObject: {
            myVariable: "This is the first object"
        }
        secondObject: {
            myVariable: "This is the second object"
        }
    }
#
    console.log(myObject.firstObject.myVariable); // This is the first object.
    console.log(myObject.secondObject); // myVariable: "This is the second object"
#
    var people = {
        john: {
            name: {
                first: "John",
                last: "Doe",
                full: "John Doe"
            },
            knownFor: "placeholder names"
        },
        bill: {
            name: {
                first: "Bill",
                last: "Gates",
                full: "Bill Gates"
            },
            knownFor: "wealth"
        }
    }
#
    console.log(people.john.name.first); // John
    console.log(people.john.name.full); // John Doe
    console.log(people.bill.knownFor); // wealth
    console.log(people.bill.name.last); // Gates
    console.log(people.bill.name.full); // Bill Gates

## Defining a Variable
    var myVariable = "This is a variable!";
This is an example of defining variables. This variable is called a "string" because it has ASCII characters (`A-Z`, `0-9`, `!@#$`, etc.)

## Using a Variable
    var number1 = 5;
    number1 = 3;
Here, we defined a number called "number1" which was equal to 5. However, on the second line, we changed the value to 3. To show the value of a variable, we log it to the console or use `window.alert()`:

    console.log(number1); // 3
    window.alert(number1); // 3
To add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc., we do like so:

    number1 = number1 + 5; // 3 + 5 = 8
    number1 = number1 - 6; // 8 - 6 = 2
    var number2 = number1 * 10; // 2 (times) 10 = 20
    var number3 = number2 / number1; // 20 (divided by) 2 = 10;

 We can also add strings which will concatenate them, or put them together. For example:

    var myString = "I am a " + "string!"; // "I am a string!"

## Types of Variables
    var myInteger = 12; // 32-bit number (from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
    var myLong = 9310141419482; // 64-bit number (from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
    var myFloat = 5.5; // 32-bit floating-point number (decimal)
    var myDouble = 9310141419482.22; // 64-bit floating-point number
    
    var myBoolean = true; // 1-bit true/false (0 or 1)
    var myBoolean2 = false;
    
    var myNotANumber = NaN;
    var NaN_Example = 0/0; // NaN: Division by Zero is not possible

    var notDefined; // undefined: we didn't define it to anything yet
    window.alert(aRandomVariable); // undefined

    var myNull = null; // null
    // to be continued...

## Arrays and Objects
    var myArray = []; // empty array
An array is a set of variables. For example:

    var favoriteFruits = ["apple", "orange", "strawberry"];
    var carsInParkingLot = ["Toyota", "Ferrari", "Lexus"];
    var employees = ["Billy", "Bob", "Joe"];
    var primeNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31];
    var randomVariables = [2, "any type works", undefined, null, true, 2.51];

    myArray = ["zero", "one", "two"];
    window.alert(myArray[0]); // 0 is the first element of an array
                              // in this case, the value would be "zero"
    myArray = ["John Doe", "Billy"];
    elementNumber = 1;
    
    window.alert(myArray[elementNumber]); // Billy

An object is a group of values; unlike arrays, we can do something better than them:

    myObject = {};
    john = {firstname: "John", lastname: "Doe", fullname: "John Doe"};
    billy = {
        firstname: "Billy",
        lastname: undefined
        fullname: "Billy"
    };
    window.alert(john.fullname); // John Doe
    window.alert(billy.firstname); // Billy
Rather than making an array `["John Doe", "Billy"]` and calling `myArray[0]`, we can just call `john.fullname` and `billy.fullname`.
