## Simple Callback Usage Examples
Callbacks offer a way to extend the functionality of a function (or method) _**without changing**_ its code. This approach is often used in modules (libraries / plugins), the code of which is not supposed to be changed.

Suppose we have written the following function, calculating the sum of a given array of values:

    function foo(array) {
        var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            sum += array[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

Now suppose that we want to do something with each value of the array, e.g. display it using `alert()`. We could make the appropriate changes in the code of `foo`, like this:

    function foo(array) {
        var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            alert(array[i]);
            sum += array[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

But what if we decide to use `console.log` instead of `alert()`? Obviously changing the code of `foo`, whenever we decide to do something else with each value, is not a good idea. It is much better to have the option to change our mind without changing the code of `foo`. That's exactly the use case for callbacks. We only have to slightly change `foo`'s signature and body:

    function foo(array, callback) {
        var sum = 0;
        for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            callback(array[i]);
            sum += array[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

And now we are able to change the behaviour of `foo` just by changing its parameters:

    var array = [];
    foo(array, alert);
    foo(array, function (x) {
        console.log(x);
    });

# Examples with Asynchronous Functions

In jQuery, the `$.getJSON()` method to fetch JSON data is asynchronous. Therefore, passing code in a callback makes sure that the code is called *after* the JSON is fetched.

`$.getJSON()` syntax:

    $.getJSON( url, dataObject, successCallback );

Example of `$.getJSON()` code:

    $.getJSON("foo.json", {}, function(data) {
        // data handling code
    });

The following would *not* work, because the data-handling code would likely be called *before* the data is actually received, because the `$.getJSON` function takes an unspecified length of time and does not hold up the call stack as it waits for the JSON.

    $.getJSON("foo.json", {});
    // data handling code

Another example of an asynchronous function is jQuery's `animate()` function. Because it takes a specified time to run the animation, sometimes it is desirable to run some code directly following the animation.

`.animate()` syntax:

    jQueryElement.animate( properties, duration, callback );

For example, to create a fading-out animation after which the element completely disappears, the following code can be run. Note the use of the callback.

    elem.animate( { opacity: 0 }, 5000, function() {
        elem.hide();
    } );

This allows the element to be hidden right after the function has finished execution. This differs from:

    elem.animate( { opacity: 0 }, 5000 );
    elem.hide();

because the latter does not wait for `animate()` (an asynchronous function) to complete, and therefore the element is hidden right away, producing an undesirable effect.



## What is a callback?
This is a normal function call:

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    console.log("Hello World!");

When you call a normal function, it does its job and then returns control back to the caller.

However, sometimes a function needs to return control back to the caller in order to do its job:

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    [1,2,3].map(function double(x) {
        return 2 * x;
    });

In the above example, the function `double` is a callback for the function `map` because:

 1. The function `double` is given to the function `map` by the caller.
 2. The function `map` needs to call the function `double` zero or more times in order to do its job.

Thus, the function `map` is essentially returning control back to the caller every time it calls the function `double`. Hence, the name &ldquo;callback&rdquo;.

---

Functions may accept more than one callback:

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    promise.then(function onFulfilled(value) {
        console.log("Fulfilled with value " + value);
    }, function onRejected(reason) {
        console.log("Rejected with reason " + reason);
    });

Here then function `then` accepts two callback functions, `onFulfilled` and `onRejected`. Furthermore, only one of these two callback functions is actually called.

What's more interesting is that the function `then` returns before either of the callbacks are called. Hence, a callback function may be called even after the original function has returned.

## Continuation (synchronous and asynchronous)
Callbacks can be used to provide code to be executed after a method has completed:
```javascript
/**
 * @arg {Function} then continuation callback
 */
function doSomething(then) {
  console.log('Doing something');
  then();
}

// Do something, then execute callback to log 'done'
doSomething(function () {
  console.log('Done');
});

console.log('Doing something else');

// Outputs:
//   "Doing something"
//   "Done"
//   "Doing something else"
```

The `doSomething()` method above executes synchronously with the callback - execution blocks until `doSomething()` returns, ensuring that the callback is executed before the interpreter moves on.

Callbacks can also be used to execute code asynchronously:
```javascript
doSomethingAsync(then) {
  setTimeout(then, 1000);
  console.log('Doing something asynchronously');
}

doSomethingAsync(function() {
  console.log('Done');
});

console.log('Doing something else');

// Outputs:
//   "Doing something asynchronously"
//   "Doing something else"
//   "Done"
```

The `then` callbacks are considered continuations of the `doSomething()` methods. Providing a callback as the last instruction in a function is called a [tail-call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call), which is [optimized by ES2015 interpreters](http://www.2ality.com/2015/06/tail-call-optimization.html).

## Callbacks and `this`
Often when using a callback you want access to a specific context. 

    function SomeClass(msg, elem) {
      this.msg = msg;
      elem.addEventListener('click', function() {
        console.log(this.msg);  // <= will fail because "this" is undefined
      });
    }

    var s = new SomeClass("hello", someElement);

# Solutions
  
* Use `bind`

   `bind` effectively generates a new function that sets `this` to whatever
   was passed to `bind` then calls the original function.      

        function SomeClass(msg, elem) {
          this.msg = msg;
          elem.addEventListener('click', function() {
            console.log(this.msg);  
          }.bind(this));  // <=-  bind the function to `this`
        }

* Use arrow functions

   Arrow functions automatically bind the current `this` context.

        function SomeClass(msg, elem) {
          this.msg = msg;
          elem.addEventListener('click',() => {   // <=-  arrow function binds `this`
            console.log(this.msg);  
          });
        }

Often you'd like to call a member function, ideally passing any arguments that were passed to the event on to the function.

## Solutions:

* Use bind

        function SomeClass(msg, elem) {
          this.msg = msg;
          elem.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this));
        }

        SomeClass.prototype.handleClick = function(event) {
          console.log(event.type, this.msg);
        };

* Use arrow functions and the rest operator

        function SomeClass(msg, elem) {
          this.msg = msg;
          elem.addEventListener('click', (...a) => this.handleClick(...a));
        }

        SomeClass.prototype.handleClick = function(event) {
          console.log(event.type, this.msg);
        };


* For DOM event listeners in particular you can implement the [`EventListener` interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener)

        function SomeClass(msg, elem) {
          this.msg = msg;
          elem.addEventListener('click', this);
        }

        SomeClass.prototype.handleEvent = function(event) {
          var fn = this[event.type];
          if (fn) {
             fn.apply(this, arguments);
          }
        };
        
        SomeClass.prototype.click = function(event) {
          console.log(this.msg);
        };




## Error handling and control-flow branching
Callbacks are often used to provide error handling. This is a form of control flow branching, where some instructions are executed only when an error occurs:
```
const expected = true;

function compare(actual, success, failure) {
  if (actual === expected) {
    success();
  } else {
    failure();
  }
}

function onSuccess() {
  console.log('Value was expected');
}

function onFailure() {
  console.log('Value was unexpected/exceptional');
}

compare(true, onSuccess, onFailure);
compare(false, onSuccess, onFailure);

// Outputs:
//   "Value was expected"
//   "Value was unexpected/exceptional"
```

Code execution in `compare()` above has two possible branches: `success` when the expected and actual values are the same, and `error` when they are different. This is especially useful when control flow should branch after some asynchronous instruction:

```
function compareAsync(actual, success, failure) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    compare(actual, success, failure)
  }, 1000);
}

compareAsync(true, onSuccess, onFailure);
compareAsync(false, onSuccess, onFailure);
console.log('Doing something else');

// Outputs:
//   "Doing something else"
//   "Value was expected"
//   "Value was unexpected/exceptional"
```

It should be noted, multiple callbacks do not have to be mutually exclusive – both methods could be called. Similarly, the `compare()` could be written with callbacks that are optional (by using a [noop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP) as the default value - see [Null Object pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern)).

## Callback using Arrow function
**Using arrow function as callback function can reduce lines of code.**


The default syntax for arrow function is 

    () => {}
This can be used as callbacks

For example if we want to print all elements in an array [1,2,3,4,5]

without arrow function, the code will look like this

    [1,2,3,4,5].forEach(function(x){
                     console.log(x);
                }

With arrow function, it can be reduced to

    [1,2,3,4,5].forEach(x => console.log(x));

Here the callback function `function(x){console.log(x)}` is reduced to `x=>console.log(x)`
