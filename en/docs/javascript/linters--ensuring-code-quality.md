No matter what linter you choose every JavaScript Project should use one. They can help find error and make code more consistent. For more comparisions check out [comparison JavaScript linting tools](https://www.sitepoint.com/comparison-javascript-linting-tools/)

## JSHint
[JSHint](http://jshint.com/) is an open source tool which detects errors and potential problems in JavaScript code.

To lint your JavaScript you have two options. 

 1. Go to [JSHint.com](http://jshint.com/) and paste your code in there
    on line text editor.
 2. Install [JSHint in your IDE](http://jshint.com/install/).
    - Atom: [linter-jshint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-jshint) (must have [Linter](https://github.com/steelbrain/linter) plugin installed)        
    - Sublime Text: [JSHint Gutter](https://github.com/victorporof/Sublime-JSHint) and/or [Sublime Linter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-for-ST2)
    - Vim: [jshint.vim](https://github.com/walm/jshint.vim) or [jshint2.vim](https://github.com/Shutnik/jshint2.vim)    
    - Visual Studio: [VSCode JSHint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jshint)

A benefit of adding it to your IDE is that you can create a JSON configuration file named `.jshintrc` that will be used when linting your program. This is convent if you want to share configurations between projects.

Example `.jshintrc` file

    {
        "-W097": false, // Allow "use strict" at document level
        "browser": true, // defines globals exposed by modern browsers http://jshint.com/docs/options/#browser
        "curly": true, // requires you to always put curly braces around blocks in loops and conditionals http://jshint.com/docs/options/#curly
        "devel": true, // defines globals that are usually used for logging poor-man's debugging: console, alert, etc. http://jshint.com/docs/options/#devel
        // List global variables (false means read only)
        "globals": {
            "globalVar": true
        },
        "jquery": true, // This option defines globals exposed by the jQuery JavaScript library.
        "newcap": false,
        // List any global functions or const vars
        "predef": [
            "GlobalFunction",
            "GlobalFunction2"
        ],
        "undef": true, // warn about undefined vars
        "unused": true // warn about unused vars
    }

JSHint also allows configurations for specific lines/blocks of code

    switch(operation)
    {
       case '+'
       {
          result = a + b;
          break;
       }

       // JSHint W086 Expected a 'break' statement
       // JSHint flag to allow cases to not need a break
       /* falls through */
       case '*':
       case 'x':
       {
          result = a * b;
          break;
       }
    }

    // JSHint disable error for variable not defined, because it is defined in another file
    /* jshint -W117 */
    globalVariable = 'in-another-file.js';
    /* jshint +W117 */

More configuration options are documented at http://jshint.com/docs/options/

## ESLint / JSCS
[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is a code style linter and formatter for your style guide [much like JSHint](http://www.slant.co/versus/8627/8628/~jshint_vs_eslint). ESLint merged with [JSCS](https://medium.com/@markelog/jscs-end-of-the-line-bc9bf0b3fdb2#.h2cktyall) in April of 2016. ESLint does take more effort to set up than JSHint, but there are clear instructions on their [website](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) for getting started.

A sample configuration for ESLint is as follows:

    {
        "rules": {
            "semi": ["error", "always"], // throw an error when semicolons are detected 
            "quotes": ["error", "double"] // throw an error when double quotes are detected
        }
    }
A sample configuration file where ALL rules are set to off, with descriptions for what they do can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/cletusw/e01a85e399ab563b1236).

## JSLint
[JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) is the trunk from which JSHint branched. JSLint takes a much more opinionated stance on how to write JavaScript code, pushing you towards only using the parts [Douglas Crockford](http://crockford.com/) deems to be its "good parts", and away from any code that Crockford believes to have a better solution. The following StackOverflow thread may help you decide [which linter is right for you](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6803574/6194193). While there are differences (here are some brief comparisons between it and [JSHint](http://www.slant.co/versus/8627/8626/~jshint_vs_jslint) / [ESLint](http://www.slant.co/versus/8628/8626/~eslint_vs_jslint)), each option is extremely customizable.

For a more information about configuring JSLint check out [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jslint) or [github](https://gist.github.com/bretdavidson/3189814#file-jslint-options-descriptions).
