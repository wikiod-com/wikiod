Grails is a very powerful rapid application development (RAD) framework, for the **Java platform** aimed at multiplying **developersâ€™ productivity** thanks to a Convention-over-Configuration, sensible defaults and opinionated APIs. It integrates smoothly with the JVM and the **Groovy language** allowing you to be **immediately productive** whilst providing powerful features, including integrated object-relational-mapping (ORM), Domain-Specific Languages (DSL), runtime and compile-time meta-programming and asynchronous programming.
