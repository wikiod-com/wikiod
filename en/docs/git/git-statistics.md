## Syntax
 - git log [\<options>] [\<revision range>] [[--] \<path>]
 - git log --pretty=short | git shortlog [\<options>]
 - git shortlog [\<options>] [\<revision range>] [[--] \<path>]

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| --------- | ------- |
| `-n`, `--numbered` | Sort output according to the number of commits per author instead of alphabetic order |
| `-s`, `--summary` | Only provide a commit count summary
| `-e`, `--email` | Show the email address of each author
| `--format`[=\<format>] | Instead of the commit subject, use some other information to describe each commit. \<format> can be any string accepted by the `--format` option of `git log`. |
| `-w`[\<width>[,\<indent1>[,\<indent2>]]] | Linewrap the output by wrapping each line at `width`. The first line of each entry is indented by `indent1` number of spaces, and subsequent lines are indented by `indent2` spaces. |
| \<revision range> | Show only commits in the specified revision range. Default to the whole history until the current commit. |
| [`--`] \<path> | Show only commits that explain how the files matching `path` came to be. Paths may need to be prefixed with "--   " to separate them from options or the revision range. |

## Lines of code per developer


    git ls-tree -r HEAD | sed -Ee 's/^.{53}//' | \
    while read filename; do file "$filename"; done | \
    grep -E ': .*text' | sed -E -e 's/: .*//' | \
    while read filename; do git blame --line-porcelain "$filename"; done | \
    sed -n 's/^author //p' | \
    sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

## Listing each branch and its last revision's date
    for k in `git branch -a | sed s/^..//`; do echo -e `git log -1 --pretty=format:"%Cgreen%ci %Cblue%cr%Creset" $k --`\\t"$k";done | sort

## Commits per developer
Git `shortlog` is used to summarize the git log outputs and group the commits by author.

By default, all commit messages are shown but argument `--summary` or `-s` skips the messages and gives a list of authors with their total number of commits.

`--numbered` or `-n` changes the ordering from alphabetical (by author ascending) to number of commits descending.

    git shortlog -sn        #Names and Number of commits

    git shortlog -sne       #Names along with their email ids and the Number of commits
or 

    git log --pretty=format:%ae \
    | gawk -- '{ ++c[$0]; } END { for(cc in c) printf "%5d %s\n",c[cc],cc; }'


**Note:** Commits by the same person may not be grouped together where their name and/or email address has been spelled differently. For example `John Doe` and `Johnny Doe` will appear separately in the list. To resolve this, refer to the `.mailmap` feature.

## Commits per date

    git log --pretty=format:"%ai" | awk '{print " : "$1}' | sort -r | uniq -c


## Total number of commits in a  branch 
    git log  --pretty=oneline |wc -l

## List all commits in pretty format
    git log --pretty=format:"%Cgreen%ci %Cblue%cn  %Cgreen%cr%Creset %s"
This will give a nice overview of all commits (1 per line) with date, user and commit message.

The `--pretty` option has many placeholders, each starting with `%`. All options can be found [here ][1]

## Find All Local Git Repositories on Computer
To list all the git repository locations on your you can run the following 

    find $HOME -type d -name ".git"

Assuming you have `locate`, this should be much faster:

    locate .git |grep git$

If you have `gnu locate` or `mlocate`, this will select only the git dirs:

    locate -ber \\.git$

## Show the total number of commits per author
In order to get the total number of commits that each developer or contributor has made on a repository, you can simply use the `git shortlog`: 

    git shortlog -s
which provides the author names and number of commits by each one.

Additionally, if you want to have the results calculated on all branches, add `--all` flag to the command:

    git shortlog -s --all
