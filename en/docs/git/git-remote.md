## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| --------- |------- |  
| -v, --verbose | Run verbosely. |
| -m \<master> | Sets head to remote's \<master> branch | 
| --mirror=fetch | Refs will not be stored in refs/remotes namespace, but instead will be mirrored in the local repo |  
| --mirror=push | `git push` will behave as if --mirror was passed | 
| --no-tags |  `git fetch <name>` does not import tags from the remote repo |  
| -t \<branch> |  Specifies the remote to track *only* \<branch> | 
| -f | `git fetch <name>` is run immediately after remote is set up | 
| --tags | `git fetch <name>` imports every tag from the remote repo | 
| -a, --auto | The symbolic-ref's HEAD is set to the same branch as the remote's HEAD | 
| -d, --delete | All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository | 
| --add |  Adds \<name> to list of currently tracked branches (set-branches)| 
| --add | Instead of changing some URL, new URL is added (set-url) | 
| --all | Push all branches. | 
| --delete | All urls matching \<url> are deleted. (set-url) | 
| --push | Push URLS are manipulated instead of fetch URLS |
| -n | The remote heads are not queried first with `git ls-remote <name>`, cached information is used instead | 
| --dry-run | report what branches will be pruned, but do not actually prune them | 
| --prune | Remove remote branches that don't have a local counterpart | 

## Display Remote Repositories
To list all configured remote repositories, use `git remote`.

It shows the short name (aliases) of each remote handle that you have configured.

    $ git remote
    premium
    premiumPro
    origin
     
To show more detailed information, the `--verbose` or `-v` flag can be used. The output will include the URL and the type of the remote (`push` or `pull`):

    $ git remote -v
    premiumPro    https://github.com/user/CatClickerPro.git (fetch)
    premiumPro    https://github.com/user/CatClickerPro.git (push)
    premium    https://github.com/user/CatClicker.git (fetch)
    premium    https://github.com/user/CatClicker.git (push)
    origin    https://github.com/ud/starter.git (fetch)
    origin    https://github.com/ud/starter.git (push)
    



## Change remote url of your Git repository
You may want to do this if the remote repository is migrated. The command for changing the remote url is:

    git remote set-url

It takes 2 arguments: an existing remote name (origin, upstream) and the url.

Check your current remote url:

    git remote -v
    origin    https://bitbucket.com/develop/myrepo.git (fetch)
    origin    https://bitbucket.com/develop/myrepo.git (push)

Change your remote url:

    git remote set-url origin https://localserver/develop/myrepo.git

Check again your remote url:

    git remote -v
    origin    https://localserver/develop/myrepo.git (fetch)
    origin    https://localserver/develop/myrepo.git (push)


## Remove a Remote Repository
Remove the remote named `<name>`. All remote-tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are removed.

To remove a remote repository `dev`:

    git remote rm dev

## Add a Remote Repository
To add a remote, use `git remote add` in the root of your local repository.

For adding a remote Git repository \<url> as an easy short name \<name> use
 
    git remote add <name> <url>

The command `git fetch <name>` can then be used to create and update remote-tracking branches `<name>/<branch>`.

## Show more information about remote repository
You can view more information about a remote repository by `git remote show <remote repository alias>`

    git remote show origin
result:

    remote origin
    Fetch URL:  https://localserver/develop/myrepo.git
    Push  URL:  https://localserver/develop/myrepo.git
    HEAD branch: master
    Remote branches:
      master      tracked
    Local branches configured for 'git pull':
      master      merges with remote master
    Local refs configured for 'git push':
      master      pushes to master      (up to date)

## Rename a Remote Repository
Rename the remote named `<old>` to `<new>`. All remote-tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are updated.

To rename a remote branch name `dev` to `dev1` :

    git remote rename dev dev1
