## Syntax
 - git clone [\<options\>] [--] \<repo\> [\<dir\>]
 - git clone [--template=<template_directory>] [-l] [-s] [--no-hardlinks] [-q] [-n] [--bare] [--mirror] [-o \<name\>] [-b \<name\>] [-u \<upload-pack\>] [--reference \<repository\>] [--dissociate] [--separate-git-dir \<git dir\>] [--depth \<depth\>] [--[no-]single-branch] [--recursive | --recurse-submodules] [--[no-]shallow-submodules] [--jobs \<n\>] [--] \<repository\> [\<directory\>]

## Shallow Clone
Cloning a huge repository (like a project with multiple years of history) might take a long time, or fail because of the amount of data to be transferred. In cases where you don't need to have the full history available, you can do a shallow clone:

```
git clone [repo_url] --depth 1
```

The above command will fetch just the last commit from the remote repository.

Be aware that you may not be able to resolve merges in a shallow repository. It's often a good idea to take at least as many commits are you are going to need to backtrack to resolve merges. For example, to instead get the last 50 commits:

    git clone [repo_url] --depth 50

Later, if required, you can the fetch the rest of the repository:

<!-- if version [gte 1.8.3] -->
    git fetch --unshallow     # equivalent of git fetch -â€“depth=2147483647
                              # fetches the rest of the repository
<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [lt 1.8.3] -->
    git fetch --depth=1000    # fetch the last 1000 commits
<!-- end version if -->

## Regular Clone
To download the entire repository including the full history and all branches, type:

    git clone <url>

The example above will place it in a directory with the same name as the repository name. 

To download the repository and save it in a specific directory, type:

    git clone <url> [directory]

For more details, visit [Clone a repository](https://www.wikiod.com/git/getting-started-with-git#Clone a repository).

## Clone a specific branch
To clone a specific branch of a repository, type `--branch <branch name>` before the repository url:

    git clone --branch <branch name> <url> [directory]

To use the shorthand option for `--branch`, type `-b`. This command downloads entire repository and checks out `<branch name>`.  

To save disk space you can clone history leading only to single branch with:

    git clone --branch <branch_name> --single-branch <url> [directory]

If `--single-branch` is not added to the command, history of all branches will be cloned into `[directory]`. This can be issue with big repositories.

----------

To later undo `--single-branch` flag and fetch the rest of repository use command:

    git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
    git fetch origin



## Clone recursively
<!-- if version [gte 1.6.5] -->

    git clone <url> --recursive

Clones the repository and also clones all submodules. If the submodules themselves contain additional submodules, Git will also clone those. 

<!-- end version if -->

## Clone using a proxy
If you need to download files with git under a proxy, setting proxy server system-wide couldn't be enough. You could also try the following:

    git config --global http.proxy http://<proxy-server>:<port>/
