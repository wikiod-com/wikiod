[Git-tfs](http://git-tfs.com/) is a third party tool to connect a Git repository to a Team Foundation Server (“TFS”) repository.

Most remote TFVS instances will request your credentials on every interaction and installing Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows may not help. It can be overcome by adding your *name* and *password* to your `.git/config`

    [tfs-remote "default"]
      url = http://tfs.mycompany.co.uk:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/
      repository = $/My.Project.Name/
      username = me.name
      password = My733TPwd

## git-tfs clone
This will create a folder with the same name as the project, i.e. /My.Project.Name

    $ git tfs clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/ $/My.Project.Name


## git-tfs clone from bare git repository
Cloning from a git repository is ten times faster than cloning directly from TFVS and works well in a team environment. At least one team member will have to create the bare git repository by doing the regular git-tfs clone first. Then the new repository can be bootstrapped to work with TFVS.

    $ git clone x:/fileshare/git/My.Project.Name.git 
    $ cd My.Project.Name 
    $ git tfs bootstrap 
    $ git tfs pull


## git-tfs install via Chocolatey
The following assumes you will use kdiff3 for file diffing and although not essential it is a good idea.
    
    C:\> choco install kdiff3

Git can be installed first so you can state any parameters you wish. Here all the Unix tools are also installed and 'NoAutoCrlf' means checkout as is, commit as is.

    C:\> choco install git -params '"/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /NoAutoCrlf"'

This is all you really need to be able to install git-tfs via chocolatey.

    C:\> choco install git-tfs


## git-tfs Check In
Launch the Check In dialog for TFVS.

    $ git tfs checkintool

This will take all of your local commits and create a single check-in.



## git-tfs push
Push all local commits to the TFVS remote.

    $ git tfs rcheckin

Note: this will fail if Check-in Notes are required. These can be bypassed by adding `git-tfs-force: rcheckin` to the commit message.
