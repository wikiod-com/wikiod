## Syntax
 - git merge **another_branch** [options]
 - git merge **--abort**

## Parameters
Parameter | Details
------ | ------
`-m`   | Message to be included in the merge commit
`-v`   | Show verbose output
`--abort` | Attempt to revert all files back to their state
`--ff-only` | Aborts instantly when a merge-commit would be required
`--no-ff` | Forces creation of a merge-commit, even if it wasn't mandatory
`--no-commit` | Pretends the merge failed to allow inspection and tweaking of the result
`--stat` | Show a diffstat after merge completion
`-n`/`--no-stat` | Don't show the diffstat
`--squash` | Allows for a single commit on the current branch with the merged changes

## Merge one branch into another


## Automatic Merging
When the commits on two branches don't conflict, Git can automatically merge them:

    ~/Stack Overflow(branch:master) Â» git merge another_branch
    Auto-merging file_a
    Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
     file_a | 2 +-
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

## Aborting a merge
After starting a merge, you might want to stop the merge and return everything to its pre-merge state. Use `--abort`:

    git merge --abort

## Keep changes from only one side of a merge
During a merge, you can pass `--ours` or `--theirs` to `git checkout` to take all changes for a file from one side or the other of a merge.

```
$ git checkout --ours   -- file1.txt # Use our version of file1, delete all their changes
$ git checkout --theirs -- file2.txt # Use their version of file2, delete all our changes
```

## Merge with a commit
Default behaviour is when the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the branch pointer, without creating a merge commit. Use `--no-ff` to resolve.

`git merge <branch_name> --no-ff -m "<commit message>"`

## Finding all branches with no merged changes
Sometimes you might have branches lying around that have already had their changes merged into master. This finds all branches that are not `master` that have no unique commits as compared to `master`. This is very useful for finding branches that were not deleted after the PR was merged into master.

     for branch in $(git branch -r) ; do
       [ "${branch}" != "origin/master" ] && [ $(git diff master...${branch} | wc -l) -eq 0 ] && echo -e `git show --pretty=format:"%ci %cr" $branch | head -n 1`\\t$branch
     done | sort -r
