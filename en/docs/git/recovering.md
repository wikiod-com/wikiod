## Recovering from a lost commit
In case you have reverted back to a past commit and lost a newer commit you can recover the lost commit by running

    git reflog

Then find your lost commit, and reset back to it by doing

    git reset HEAD --hard <sha1-of-commit>

## Restore a deleted file after a commit
In case you have accidentally commited a delete on a file and later realized that you need it back.

First find the commit id of the commit that deleted your file.

    git log --diff-filter=D --summary

Will give you a sorted summary of commits which deleted files.

Then proceed to restore the file by

    git checkout 81eeccf~1 <your-lost-file-name>
(Replace  81eeccf with your own commit id)

## Restore file to a previous version
To restore a file to a previous version you can use `reset`.

    git reset <sha1-of-commit> <file-name>

If you have already made local changes to the file (that you do not require!) you can also use the `--hard` option

## Recover a deleted branch
To recover a deleted branch you need to find the commit which was the head of your deleted branch by running

    git reflog

You can then recreate the branch by running

    git checkout -b <branch-name> <sha1-of-commit>

You will not be able to recover deleted branches if git's [garbage collector][1] deleted dangling commits - those without refs. Always have a backup of your repository, especially when you work in a small team / proprietary project

## Recovering from a reset
## With Git, you can (almost) always turn the clock back

Don't be afraid to experiment with commands that rewrite history*. Git doesn't delete your commits for 90 days by default, and during that time you can easily recover them from the reflog:

    $ git reset @~3   # go back 3 commits
    $ git reflog
    c4f708b HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to @~3
    2c52489 HEAD@{1}: commit: more changes
    4a5246d HEAD@{2}: commit: make important changes
    e8571e4 HEAD@{3}: commit: make some changes
    ... earlier commits ...
    $ git reset 2c52489
    ... and you're back where you started

\* *Watch out for options like `--hard` and `--force` though â€” they can discard data.*  
\*  *Also, avoid rewriting history on any branches you're collaborating on.*

## Recover from git stash
To get your most recent stash after running git stash, use 

    git stash apply

To see a list of your stashes, use

    git stash list

You will get a list that looks something like this

    stash@{0}: WIP on master: 67a4e01 Merge tests into develop
    stash@{1}: WIP on master: 70f0d95 Add user role to localStorage on user login

Choose a different git stash to restore with the number that shows up for the stash you want

    git stash apply stash@{2}

You can also choose 'git stash pop', it works same as 'git stash apply' like..
    
     git stash pop 
      
   or

     git stash pop stash@{2}

Difference in git stash apply and git stash pop...

   **git stash pop**:- stash data will be remove from stack of stash list.

   Ex:-

    git stash list

   You will get a list that looks something like this

    stash@{0}: WIP on master: 67a4e01 Merge tests into develop
    stash@{1}: WIP on master: 70f0d95 Add user role to localStorage on user login

   Now pop stash data using command
    
    git stash pop

   Again Check for stash list 

    git stash list

   You will get a list that looks something like this
    
     stash@{0}: WIP on master: 70f0d95 Add user role to localStorage on user login
    
   You can see one stash data is removed (popped) from stash list and stash@{1} became stash@{0}.
