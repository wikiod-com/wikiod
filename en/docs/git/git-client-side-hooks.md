Like many other Version Control Systems, Git has a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur. There are two groups of these hooks: client-side and server-side. Client-side hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging, while server-side hooks run on network operations such as receiving pushed commits. You can use these hooks for all sorts of reasons.

## Git pre-push hook
**pre-push** script is called by `git push` after it has checked the remote status, but before anything has been pushed.  If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing will be pushed.

This hook is called with the following parameters:

     $1 -- Name of the remote to which the push is being done (Ex: origin)
     $2 -- URL to which the push is being done (Ex: https://<host>:<port>/<username>/<project_name>.git)


Information about the commits which are being pushed is supplied as lines to the standard input in the form: 

    <local_ref> <local_sha1> <remote_ref> <remote_sha1>

   
Sample values: 

    local_ref = refs/heads/master
    local_sha1 = 68a07ee4f6af8271dc40caae6cc23f283122ed11
    remote_ref = refs/heads/master
    remote_sha1 = efd4d512f34b11e3cf5c12433bbedd4b1532716f


Below example pre-push script was taken from default pre-push.sample which was automatically created when a new repository is initialized with `git init`

    # This sample shows how to prevent push of commits where the log message starts
    # with "WIP" (work in progress).
    
    remote="$1"
    url="$2"
    
    z40=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    
    while read local_ref local_sha remote_ref remote_sha
    do
        if [ "$local_sha" = $z40 ]
        then
            # Handle delete
            :
        else
            if [ "$remote_sha" = $z40 ]
            then
                # New branch, examine all commits
                range="$local_sha"
            else
                # Update to existing branch, examine new commits
                range="$remote_sha..$local_sha"
            fi
    
            # Check for WIP commit
            commit=`git rev-list -n 1 --grep '^WIP' "$range"`
            if [ -n "$commit" ]
            then
                echo >&2 "Found WIP commit in $local_ref, not pushing"
                exit 1
            fi
        fi
    done
    
    exit 0

## Installing a Hook
The hooks are all stored in the `hooks` sub directory of the Git directory. In most projects, thatâ€™s `.git/hooks`.

To enable a hook script, put a file in the `hooks` subdirectory of your `.git` directory that is named appropriately (without any extension) and is executable.
