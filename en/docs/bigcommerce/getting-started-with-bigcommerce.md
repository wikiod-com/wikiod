## Getting Started with BigCommerce
1. Go to the [BigCommerce][1] homepage.

2. Enter a store name in the field labeled **Create your store name**, then click **Start my free trial now**.

> Your store name can be changed at any time after starting your trial.

3. Fill out the new trial store form, then click **Create my store now**.


Once your trial is created you'll be prompted to log in for the first time.

 1. Enter the email address and password you set when creating your trial, then click **Log In**.
 
You can now use your trial store and new account to get started with the [Stencil frontend framework][2] or begin [building an OAuth app][3]. 

When you login to the Developer Portal to get OAuth credentials for the first time, you'll be prompted to authorize the Developer Portal application.

1. To obtain these credentials, click **My Apps** in this site's upper-right-hand corner, and log in to your BigCommerce account.
2. Once inside the Developer Portal, click **Create an app**. You can provide any name you'd like, such as "Test".
3. Click **View Client ID** in order to obtain your **Client Secret** and **Client ID**.
