GDB (GNU Project debugger) is a command line base debugger that is good at analyzing running and cored programs.  According to the [user manual][1] GDB supports C, C++, D, Go, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, OpenCL C, Pascal, Rust, assembly, Modula-2, and Ada.  

GDB has the same feature set as most debuggers but is different from most that I have used in that is all based on typing commands instead of clicking on GUI elements. Some of these features include:

 - Setting break points
 - Printing the value of variables.
 - Setting the value of variables to test things out.  
 - Viewing the stack
