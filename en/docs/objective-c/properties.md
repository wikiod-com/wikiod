## Syntax
* @property (*optional_attributes, ...*) *type* *identifier*;
* @synthesize *identifier* = *optional_backing_ivar*;
* @dynamic *identifier*;

## Parameters
| Attribute | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `atomic` | *Implicit.* Enables synchronization in synthesized accessor methods.
| `nonatomic` | Disables synchronization in the synthesized accessor methods.
| `readwrite` | *Implicit.* Synthesizes getter, setter and backing ivar.
| `readonly` | Synthesizes only the getter method and backing ivar, which can be assigned directly.
| `getter=`*name* | Specifies the name of getter method, implicit is `propertyName`.
| `setter=`*name* | Specifies the name of setter method, implicity is `setPropertyName:`. Colon `:` must be a part of the name.
| `strong` | *Implicit for objects under ARC*. The backing ivar is synthesized using `__strong`, which prevents deallocation of referenced object.
| `retain` | Synonym for `strong`.
| `copy` | Same as `strong`, but the synthesized setter also calls `-copy` on the new value.
| `unsafe_unretained` | *Implicit, except for objects under ARC.* The backing ivar is synthesized using `__unsafe_unretained`, which (for obejcts) results in dangling pointer once the referenced object deallocates. 
| `assign` | Synonym for `unsafe_unretained`. Suitable for non-object types.
| `weak` | Backing ivar is synthesized using `__weak`, so the value will be nullified once the referenced object is deallocated.
| `class` | Property accessors are synthesized as class methods, instead of instance methods. No backing storage is synthesized.
| `nullable` | The property accepts `nil` values. Mainly used for Swift bridging.
| `nonnull` | The property doesn’t accept `nil` values. Mainly used for Swift bridging.
| `null_resettable` | The property accepts `nil` values  in setter, but never returns `nil` values from getter. Your custom implementation of getter or setter must ensure this behavior. Mainly used for Swift bridging.
| `null_unspecified` | _Implicit._ The property doesn’t specify handling of `nil` values. Mainly used for Swift bridging.

## Custom getters and setters
The default property getters and setters can be overridden:

    @interface TestClass
    
    @property NSString *someString;

    @end
    
    @implementation TestClass

    // override the setter to print a message
    - (void)setSomeString:(NSString *)newString {
        NSLog(@"Setting someString to %@", newString);
        // Make sure to access the ivar (default is the property name with a _ 
        // at the beginning) because calling self.someString would call the same
        // method again leading to an infinite recursion
        _someString = newString;
    }

    - (void)doSomething {
        // The next line will call the setSomeString: method
        self.someString = @"Test";
    }

    @end

This can be useful to provide, for example, lazy initialization (by overriding the getter to set the initial value if it has not yet been set):

    - (NSString *)someString {
        if (_someString == nil) {
            _someString = [self getInitialValueForSomeString];
        }
        return _someString;
    }

You can also make a property that computes its value in the getter:

    @interface Circle : NSObject
    
    @property CGPoint origin;
    @property CGFloat radius;
    @property (readonly) CGFloat area;
    
    @end
    
    @implementation Circle
    
    - (CGFloat)area {
        return M_PI * pow(self.radius, 2);
    }
    
    @end

## What are properties?
Here is an example class which has a couple of instance variables, without using properties:

    @interface TestClass : NSObject {
        NSString *_someString;
        int _someInt;
    }
    
    -(NSString *)someString;
    -(void)setSomeString:(NSString *)newString;
    
    -(int)someInt;
    -(void)setSomeInt:(NSString *)newInt;
    
    @end
    
    
    @implementation TestClass
    
    -(NSString *)someString {
        return _someString;
    }
    
    -(void)setSomeString:(NSString *)newString {
        _someString = newString;
    }
    
    -(int)someInt {
        return _someInt;
    }
    
    -(void)setSomeInt:(int)newInt {
        _someInt = newInt;
    }
    
    @end

This is quite a lot of boilerplate code to create a simple instance variable.  You have to create the instance variable & create accessor methods which do nothing except set or return the instance variable.  So with Objective-C 2.0, Apple introduced properties, which auto-generate some or all of the boilerplate code.

Here is the above class rewritten with properties:

    @interface TestClass
    
    @property NSString *someString;
    @property int someInt;
    
    @end
    
    
    @implementation testClass
    
    @end

A property is an instance variable paired with auto-generated getters and setters.  For a property called `someString`, the getter and setter are called `someString` and `setSomeString:` respectively.  The name of the instance variable is, by default, the name of the property prefixed with an underscore (so the instance variable for `someString` is called `_someString`, but this can be overridden with an `@synthesize` directive in the `@implementation` section:

    @synthesize someString=foo;    //names the instance variable "foo"
    @synthesize someString;    //names it "someString"
    @synthesize someString=_someString;        //names it "_someString"; the default if 
                                               //there is no @synthesize directive

Properties can be accessed by calling the getters and setters:

    [testObject setSomeString:@"Foo"];
    NSLog(@"someInt is %d", [testObject someInt]);

They can also be accessed using dot notation:

    testObject.someString = @"Foo";
    NSLog(@"someInt is %d", testObject.someInt);

## Properties that cause updates
This object, `Shape` has a property `image` that depends on `numberOfSides` and `sideWidth`. If either one of them is set, than the `image` has to be recalculated. But recalculation is presumably long, and only needs to be done once if both properties are set, so the `Shape` provides a way to set both properties and only recalculate once. This is done by setting the property ivars directly.

In `Shape.h`

```
@interface Shape {
    NSUInteger numberOfSides;
    CGFloat sideWidth;

    UIImage * image;
}

// Initializer that takes initial values for the properties.
- (instancetype)initWithNumberOfSides:(NSUInteger)numberOfSides withWidth:(CGFloat)width;

// Method that allows to set both properties in once call.
// This is useful if setting these properties has expensive side-effects.
// Using a method to set both values at once allows you to have the side-
// effect executed only once.
- (void)setNumberOfSides:(NSUInteger)numberOfSides andWidth:(CGFloat)width;

// Properties using default attributes.
@property NSUInteger numberOfSides;
@property CGFloat sideWidth;

// Property using explicit attributes.
@property(strong, readonly) UIImage * image;

@end
```

In `Shape.m`

```
@implementation AnObject

// The variable name of a property that is auto-generated by the compiler
// defaults to being the property name prefixed with an underscore, for
// example "_propertyName". You can change this default variable name using
// the following statement:
// @synthesize propertyName = customVariableName;

- (id)initWithNumberOfSides:(NSUInteger)numberOfSides withWidth:(CGFloat)width {
    if ((self = [self init])) {
       [self setNumberOfSides:numberOfSides andWidth:width];
    }

    return self;
}

- (void)setNumberOfSides:(NSUInteger)numberOfSides {
    _numberOfSides = numberOfSides;

    [self updateImage];
}

- (void)setSideWidth:(CGFloat)sideWidth {
    _sideWidth = sideWidth;

    [self updateImage];
}

- (void)setNumberOfSides:(NSUInteger)numberOfSides andWidth:(CGFloat)sideWidth {
    _numberOfSides = numberOfSides;
    _sideWidth = sideWidth;

    [self updateImage];
}

// Method that does some post-processing once either of the properties has
// been updated.
- (void)updateImage {
    ...
}

@end
```

When properties are assigned to (using `object.property = value`), the setter method `setProperty:` is called. This setter, even if provided by `@synthesize`, can be overridden, as it is in this case for `numberOfSides` and `sideWidth`. However, if you set an property's ivar directly (through `property` if the object is self, or `object->property`), it doesn't call the getter or setter, allowing you to do things like multiple property sets that only call one update or bypass side-effects caused by the setter.
