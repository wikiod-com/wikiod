## Syntax
*    typedef struct { *typeA propertyA*; *typeB propertyB*; ... } *StructName*

In Objective C, you should almost always use an object instead of a struct. However, there are still cases where using a struct is better, such as:

*    When you're going to be creating and destroying a lot of values of the (struct) type, so you need good performance and small memory usage
>    *    Structs are faster to create and use because when calling a method on an object, the method has to be determined at runtime
>    *    Structs take up less size because objects have an extra property `isa`, which holds their class
*    When the value has only a couple of properties and a small total size (take `CGSize`; it has 2 floats which are 4 bytes each, so it can take up 8 bytes), and is going to be used a lot (ties in with the first point)
*    When you could use [unions][1] or [bitfields][2], and importantly, *need the size saved by them* because you need small memory usage (ties in with the first point)
*    When you *really* want to store an array inside of the struct, since Objective-C objects can't directly store C-arrays. However, note that you can still "indirectly" get an array in an Objective-C object by making it a reference (i.e. `type *` in place of the C-array `type[]`)
*    When you need to communicate with some other code, such as a library, that's coded in C; structs are fully implemented in C but objects are not

## CGPoint
One really good example of a struct is `CGPoint`; it's a simple value that represents a 2-dimensional point. It has 2 properties, `x` and `y`, and can be written as
```
typedef struct {
    CGFloat x;
    CGFloat y;
} CGPoint;
```
If you used Objective-C for Mac or iOS app development before, you've almost certainly come across `CGPoint`; `CGPoint`s hold the position of pretty much everything on screen, from views and controls to objects in a game to changes in a gradient. This means that `CGPoint`s are used a lot. This is even more true with really performance-heavy games; these games tend to have a lot of objects, and all of these objects need positions. These positions are often either `CGPoint`s, or some other type of struct that conveys a point (such as a 3-dimensional point for 3d games).

Points like `CGPoint` could easily be represented as objects, like
```
@interface CGPoint {
    CGFloat x;
    CGFloat y;
}

... //Point-related methods (e.g. add, isEqualToPoint, etc.)

@property(nonatomic, assign)CGFloat x;
@property(nonatomic, assign)CGFloat y;

@end

@implementation CGPoint

@synthesize x, y;

...

@end
```
However, if `CGPoint` was used in this way it would take a lot longer to create and manipulate points. In smaller, faster programs this wouldn't really cause a difference, and in those cases it would be OK or maybe even better to use object points. But in large programs where points are be used a lot, using objects as points can really hurt performance, making the program slower, and also waste memory, which could force the program to crash.

## Defining a Structure and Accessing Structure Members
The format of the struct statement is this:

    struct [structure tag]
    {
       member definition;
       member definition;
       ...
       member definition;
    } [one or more structure variables]; 

Example: declare the ThreeFloats structure:

       typedef struct {
        float x, y, z;
    } ThreeFloats;
 
    @interface MyClass
    - (void)setThreeFloats:(ThreeFloats)threeFloats;
    - (ThreeFloats)threeFloats;
    @end


Sending an instance of MyClass the message valueForKey: with the parameter @"threeFloats" will invoke the MyClass method threeFloats and return the result wrapped in an NSValue.
