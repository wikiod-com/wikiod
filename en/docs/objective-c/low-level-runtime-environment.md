In order to use the Objective-C runtime, you need to import it.

    #import <objc/objc.h>

## Augmenting methods using Method Swizzling
The Objective-C runtime allows you to change the implementation of a method at runtime. This is called _method swizzling_ and is often used to exchange the implementations of two methods. For example, if the methods `foo` and `bar` are exchanged, sending the message `foo` will now execute the implementation of `bar` and vice versa.

This technique can be used to augment or "patch" existing methods which you cannot edit directly, such as methods of system-provided classes.

In the following example, the `-[NSUserDefaults synchronize]` method is augmented to print the execution time of the original implementation.

**IMPORTANT:** Many people try to do swizzling using `method_exchangeImplementations`. However, this approach is dangerous if you need to call the method you're replacing, because you'll be calling it using a different selector than it is expecting to receive. As a result, your code can break in strange and unexpected waysâ€”particularly if multiple parties swizzle an object in this way.  Instead, you should always do swizzling using `setImplementation` in conjunction with a C function, allowing you to call the method with the original selector.


    #import "NSUserDefaults+Timing.h"
    #import <objc/runtime.h> // Needed for method swizzling

    static IMP old_synchronize = NULL;

    static void new_synchronize(id self, SEL _cmd);
    
    @implementation NSUserDefaults(Timing)

    + (void)load
    {
        Method originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([self class], @selector(synchronize:));
        IMP swizzleImp = (IMP)new_synchronize;
        old_synchronize = method_setImplementation(originalMethod, swizzleImp);
    }
    @end

    static void new_synchronize(id self, SEL _cmd);
    {
        NSDate *started;
        BOOL returnValue;

        started = [NSDate date];
   
        // Call the original implementation, passing the same parameters
        // that this function was called with, including the selector.
        returnValue = old_synchronize(self, _cmd);

   
        NSLog(@"Writing user defaults took %f seconds.", [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDate:started]);

        return returnValue;
    }
    
    @end

If you need to swizzle a method that takes parameters, you just add them as additional parameters to the function.  For example:

    static IMP old_viewWillAppear_animated = NULL;
    static void new_viewWillAppear_animated(id self, SEL _cmd, BOOL animated);

    ...

    Method originalMethod = class_getClassMethod([UIViewController class], @selector(viewWillAppear:));
    IMP swizzleImp = (IMP)new_viewWillAppear_animated;
    old_viewWillAppear_animated = method_setImplementation(originalMethod, swizzleImp);

    ...

    static void new_viewWillAppear_animated(id self, SEL _cmd, BOOL animated)
    {
        ...

        old_viewWillAppear_animated(self, _cmd, animated);

        ...
    }


## Attach object to another existing object (association)
It's possible to attach an object to an existing object as if there was a new property. This is called _association_ and allows one to extend existing objects. It can be used to provide storage when adding a property via a class extension or otherwise add additional information to an existing object.

The associated object is automatically released by the runtime once the target object is deallocated.


    #import <objc/runtime.h>
    
    // "Key" for association. Its value is never used and doesn't
    // matter. The only purpose of this global static variable is to
    // provide a guaranteed unique value at runtime: no two distinct 
    // global variables can share the same address.
    static char key;
    
    id target = ...;
    id payload = ...;
    objc_setAssociateObject(target, &key, payload, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN);
    // Other useful values are OBJC_ASSOCIATION_COPY
    // and OBJ_ASSOCIATION_ASSIGN
    
    id queryPayload = objc_getAssociatedObject(target, &key);


## Calling methods directly
If you need to call an Objective-C method from C code, you have two ways: using `objc_msgSend`, or obtaining the `IMP` (method implementation function pointer) and calling that.

    #import <objc/objc.h>
    
    @implementation Example
    
    - (double)negate:(double)value {
        return -value;
    }
    
    - (double)invert:(double)value {
        return 1 / value;
    }
    
    @end
    
    // Calls the selector on the object. Expects the method to have one double argument and return a double.
    double performSelectorWithMsgSend(id object, SEL selector, double value) {
        // We declare pointer to function and cast `objc_msgSend` to expected signature.
        // WARNING: This step is important! Otherwise you may get unexpected results!
        double (*msgSend)(id, SEL, double) = (typeof(msgSend)) &objc_msgSend;
    
        // The implicit arguments of self and _cmd need to be passed in addition to any explicit arguments.
        return msgSend(object, selector, value);
    }
    
    // Does the same as the above function, but by obtaining the method's IMP.
    double performSelectorWithIMP(id object, SEL selector, double value) {
        // Get the method's implementation.
        IMP imp = class_getMethodImplementation([self class], selector);
    
        // Cast it so the types are known and ARC can work correctly.
        double (*callableImp)(id, SEL, double) = (typeof(callableImp)) imp;
    
        // Again, you need the explicit arguments.
        return callableImp(object, selector, value);
    } 

    int main() {
        Example *e = [Example new];

        // Invoke negation, result is -4
        double x = performSelectorWithMsgSend(e, @selector(negate:), 4);
    
        // Invoke inversion, result is 0.25
        double y = performSelectorWithIMP(e, @selector(invert:), 4);
    }

`objc_msgSend` works by obtaining the IMP for the method and calling that. The `IMP`s for the last several methods called are cached, so if you're sending an Objective-C message in a very tight loop you can get acceptable performance. In some cases, manually caching the IMP can give slightly better performance, although this is a last resort optimization.
