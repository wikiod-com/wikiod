 - Some implementations of Markdown, such as Stack Exchange's, support [spoiler quotes](https://www.wikiod.com/markdown/markdown-spoilers-or-hidden-text#Creating spoilers), which look the same, but hide the content of the quote until you click on it.

## Quoting
By adding `>` in front of a line, you can create quoted text!

    > I am a quote

> I am a quote!


## Nested Quotes
You can nest quotes simply by including multiple `>` characters, like so:

    > Often makes no sense.
    > > Commenting above your quote…

> Often makes no sense.
> > Commenting above your quote…
