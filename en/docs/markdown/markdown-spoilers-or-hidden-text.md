This spoiler syntax is specific to Stack Exchange, and is not part of a standard markdown syntax.

## Creating spoilers
Spoilers are used to hide text or images that would otherwise negatively impact another user's experience. They can be created using `>!`

    >!This is hidden until your cursor hovers on top of it

>!This is hidden until your cursor hovers on top of it

Note: This is not part of standard markup spec and it won't be rendered in all the markdown parsers.
