## Customizing the VM Options
You can override the default `vmoptions` with your own personal settings by choosing **Help > Edit Custom VM Options** from the toolbar. This will create a local copy of the file which you are free to edit.

For example, if you double the value set for `Xmx`, the maximum size of the memory allocation pool will be doubled after you restart the IDE. On many machines this will lead to faster performance.

See the options [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/java.html) for a description of each parameter.
