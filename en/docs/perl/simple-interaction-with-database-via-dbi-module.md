## Parameters
| Column | Column |
| ------ | ------ |
|`$driver`     | Driver for DB, "Pg" for Postgresql and "mysql" for MySQL|
|`$database`   | your database name|
|`$userid`     | your database id|
|`$password`   | your database password|
|`$query`      | put your query here, ex: "select * from $your_table"|





## DBI module
You should make sure that module DBI has been installed on your pc, then follow the bellow steps:

1. use DBI module in your perl script

`use DBI;`

2. Declare some primary parameters

`my $driver    = "MyDriver";`

`my $database  = "DB_name";`

`my $dsn       = "DBI:$driver:dbname=$database";`

`my $userid    = "your_user_ID";`

`my $password  = "your_password";`

`my $tablename = "your_table";`

3. Connect to your database

`my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $userid, $password);`

4. Prepare your query

`my $query = $dbh->prepare("Your DB query");`

Ex: 

`$my_query = qq/SELECT * FROM table WHERE column1 = 2/;`

`my $query = $dbh->prepare($my_query);`

We can also use variable in the query, like below:

`my $table_name = "table";`

`my $filter_value = 2;`

`$my_query = qq/SELECT * FROM $table_name WHERE column1 = $filter_value/;`

5. Execute your query

`$query->execute();`

*Note: To avoid injection attack, you should use placeholders `?` instead of put your variable in the query.

Ex: you want to show the all data from 'table' where column1=$value1 and column2=$value2:

`my $query = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column1 = ? AND column2 = ?;");`

`$query->execute($value1, $value2);`

6. Fletch your data

`my @row = $query->fetchrow_array();` store data as array

or 

`my $ref = $sth->fetchrow_hashref();` store data as hash reference

7. Finish and disconnect DB

`$sth->finish;`

`$dbh->disconnect();`
