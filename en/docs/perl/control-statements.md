## Conditionals
Perl supports many kinds of conditional statements (statements that are based on boolean results). The most common conditional statements are if-else, unless, and ternary statements. `given` statements are introduced as a switch-like construct from C-derived languages and are available in versions Perl 5.10 and above.

### If-Else Statements

The basic structure of an if-statement is like this:

    if (EXPR) BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ...
    if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK



For simple if-statements, the if can precede or succeed the code to be executed.

    $number = 7;
    if ($number > 4) { print "$number is greater than four!"; }

    # Can also be written this way
    print "$number is greater than four!" if $number > 4;

## Loops
Perl supports many kinds of loop constructs: for/foreach, while/do-while, and until. 

    @numbers = 1..42;
    for (my $i=0; $i <= $#numbers; $i++) {
        print "$numbers[$i]\n";
    }

    #Can also be written as
    foreach my $num (@numbers) {
        print "$num\n";
    }

The while loop evaluates the conditional *before* executing the associated block. So, sometimes the block is never executed. For example, the following code would never be executed if the filehandle `$fh` was the filehandle for an empty file, or if was already exhausted before the conditional.

    while (my $line = readline $fh) {
        say $line;
    }

The `do`/`while` and `do`/`until` loops, on the other hand, evaluate the conditional *after* each time the block is executed. So, a `do`/`while` or a `do`/`until` loop is always executed at least once. 

    my $greeting_count = 0;
    do {
        say "Hello";
        $greeting_count++;
    } until ( $greeting_count > 1)

    # Hello
    # Hello
