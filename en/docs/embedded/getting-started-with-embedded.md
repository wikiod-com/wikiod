## Embedded systems development architecture
Basic architecture examples on how development for embedded systems works (i.e. IDEs, cross-compiling, downloading, in-line debugging, JTAG,...) and what would be the minimum requirements for starting.

It would be worth mentioning different approaches and platforms from begginers-higher level to advanced-lower level, like from Arduino, Raspberry, Launchpad to direct development using C on MSP, ATxx, ARMxx, etc... Not necessarily detailed but from a global point of view.
