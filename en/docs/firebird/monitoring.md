With Firebird 2.1 and databases with [ODS 11.1 (and higher)][1] Firebird introduces the ability to monitor server-side activity happening inside a particular database.

Complete database monitoring is available to SYSDBA and the database owner. Regular users are restricted to the information about their own attachments onlyâ€”other attachments are invisible to them.

Available monitoring tables since Firebird 2.1 and ODS 11.1:

 - MON$DATABASE (connected database)
 - MON$ATTACHMENTS (connected attachments)
 - MON$TRANSACTIONS (started transactions)
 - MON$STATEMENTS (prepared statements)
 - MON$CALL_STACK (call stack of active PSQL requests)
 - MON$IO_STATS (I/O statistics)
 - MON$RECORD_STATS (record-level statistics)

Reference: [Firebird 2.1 Release Notes][2]

With Firebird 2.5 and databases with [ODS 11.2 (and higher)][1] Firebird adds the following new monitor tables

 - MON$MEMORY_USAGE (current memory usage)
 - MON$CONTEXT_VARIABLES (known context variables)

    SELECT
           a.mon$attachment_id as Attachment_ID,
           a.mon$server_pid as Server_PID, 
           case a.mon$state 
              when 1 then 'active'
              when 0 then 'idle'

           a.mon$timestamp as Established_At,
           case a.mon$garbage_collection 
              when 1 then 'allowed'
              when 0 then 'not allowed'

           mon$attachments a, rdb$character_sets cs
        where 
           (a.mon$character_set_id = cs.rdb$character_set_id)
