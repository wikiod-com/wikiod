Django Admin is the <abbr title="Create Read Update Delete">CRUD</abbr> interface of [Django][1] web framework. It is mostly automatically generated but can be widely customize. However, you must keep in mind that it is designed **for trusted users only** and has its limits. In any case, you must **never give admin access to untrusted users**.

Django Admin provides a high level of customization, but be careful of not falling too much customization details. If you do so, it's probably time to create you own custom interface without Django Admin at all.
