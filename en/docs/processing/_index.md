Processing is an open source programming language and environment for people who want to create images, animations, and interactions.

[Processing][1] refers to the language built on top of Java and the minimal IDE it ships with. It is free and open-source, runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, and can output for screens, print, 3D packages and CNC printing.

The language simplifies a lot of complex concepts and eases the entry of designers, artists and non-programmers to the world of programming. 

Over the years it was used to produce a number of projects ranging from [data visualization][2], to [physical computing][3] , [games][4], [3D][5], [sound][6], [live perfomance][7], and [more][8].

Due to its vibrant community, Processing not only enjoys a contribution of over 100 libraries, but is also present on major mobile platforms such as [Android][9] and [iOS][10].

There are online communities for sharing Processing content, like [OpenProcessing][11].

Some websites even allow users to learn and use Processing directly in the browser, like the Flash-driven [SketchPatch][12] and the JavaScript-driven [HasCanvas][13],[Sketchpad][14] and [p5.js][15](pure JS).

There are also Processing ports to the following languages:

 - JavaScript using [ProcessingJS][16] or [p5js][15]
 - [ActionScript][17]
 - Python (see [NodeBox][18], [Field][19], [pyProcessing][20] or the new official [Python Mode][21])
 - [Scala][22]
 - [Clojure][23]
 - [Ruby][24]

The [Android mode][25] allows to run Processing sketches as Android applications with little or no changes in the code by automating tasks from project setup to _.apk_ file export. Android Processing sketches also have access to the underlying Android sensors and devices.

Advanced users are not constrained to the Processing IDE; they can set up [Processing projects in Eclipse][26]; use [proclipsing][27] or alternatively use [Sublime Text][28] to build and run sketch via the [processing-sublime][29] package.
