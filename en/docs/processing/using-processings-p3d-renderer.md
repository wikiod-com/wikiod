A reference for using P3D is found at https://processing.org/tutorials/p3d/ in a tutorial by Daniel Shiffman.

## Getting Started
To be able to use the P3D renderer you must specify it in the `size()` function
    
    size(200, 200, P3D);

Now, there are three axes: `x`, `y` and `z`.

Now you can proceed in drawing in 3D.
