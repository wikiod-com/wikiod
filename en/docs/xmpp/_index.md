The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a network protocol that uses XML to exchange structured data between two or more network connected entities in near-real-time. XMPP was created to satisfy the IETFs guidelines for instant messaging and presence protocols ([RFC 2779][rfc2779]), but its purpose goes far beyond IM. It is also used as a message-oriented middleware, for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and for the Internet of Things (IoT).

The lightweight XMPP core protocol provides users with
- strong authentication
- global addresses
- structured and extensible format for data exchange

The extensible approach makes it possible to build custom protocols on top of XMPP core.

The core XMPP protocol is defined in [RFC 6120][rfc6120] and is managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (XMPP). The instant messaging extensions are defined in [RFC 6121][rfc6121], and a third document ([RFC 7622][rfc7622]) defines the format of XMPP addresses, also called "Jabber Identifiers" (JIDs). Additional functionality is specified in the form of [XMPP Extension Protocols][xep-0001] (XEPs), which are created by the community and maintained by the [XMPP Standards Foundation][xsf] (XSF).
