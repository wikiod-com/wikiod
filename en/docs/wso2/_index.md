WSO2 products make heavy use of Java technology and are built on top of Carbon, the company's SOA middleware platform. Carbon makes use of Apache Axis2 and encapsulates major SOA functionality[20] such as data services, business process management, ESB routing/transformation, rules, security, throttling, caching, logging and monitoring. WSO2 products are built on top of this platform.
