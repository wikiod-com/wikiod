## Installation or Setup
Detailed instructions on getting WSO2 set up or installed.

Almost all the WSO2 Products can be started using the wso2server.sh/bat files that can be found in the <Product_Home>/bin folder of each product. When you run the sh/bat script it will star the particular WSO2 product with default settings and h2 as the database.
