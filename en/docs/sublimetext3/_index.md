Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. It has a Python application programming interface (API). It supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.

[Sublime Text 3][1] is currently in beta. The latest build is 3114. 

ST3 runs on the following operating systems:

- OS X (10.7 or later is required) 
- Windows 32 bit - also available as a portable version 
- Windows 64 bit - also available as a portable version 
- Ubuntu 32 bit - also available as a tarball for other Linux distributions.
- Ubuntu 64 bit - also available as a tarball for other Linux distributions. 

Sublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must be purchased for continued use. There is currently no enforced time limit for the evaluation.

Build 3103 (released Feb 2016) was the first build available to everyone with the new syntax definition format, `.sublime-syntax`. This allows for richer syntax highlighting and better performance compared to the legacy `.tmLanguage` format. 3103 also features a custom regex engine that significantly speeds up file loading and indexing.
