Django advertises itself as "the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines" and "Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code". It can be seen as an MVC architecture. At it's core it has:

 - a lightweight and standalone web server for development and testing
 - a form serialization and validation system that can translate between HTML forms and values suitable for storage in the database
 - a template system that utilizes the concept of inheritance borrowed from object-oriented programming
 - a caching framework that can use any of several cache methods
support for middleware classes that can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions
 - an internal dispatcher system that allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signals
 - an internationalization system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages
 - a serialization system that can produce and read XML and/or JSON representations of Django model instances
 - a system for extending the capabilities of the template engine
 - an interface to Python's built in unit test framework
