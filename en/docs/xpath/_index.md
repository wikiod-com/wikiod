XPath is a language for addressing parts of an XML document.

It is used in XSLT and is a subset of XQuery.  Libraries are available for most other programming languages as well.

XPath is an international standard with specifications published by W3C:

 - XPath 2.0: [XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0 (Second Edition)][2]
