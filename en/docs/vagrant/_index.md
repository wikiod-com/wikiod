Vagrant a software tool used to create and configure virtual development environments. It works as wrapper over other virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware. Vagrant itself is a command-line utility.

Vagrant boxes are configured using special `Vagrantfile` config written in Ruby but may include additional configuration scripts written in bash, Chef or Puppet. Developers in a team can download the Vagrant configuration files from a common source and re-create the same development environment locally.
