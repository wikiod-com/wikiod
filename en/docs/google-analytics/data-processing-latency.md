## What is Data processing latency?
When a hit is sent to Google Analytics the data must be processed.  Processing latency is 24-48 hours. This means that it can take time before you will see data under standard reports (Not real-time) any data that you do see may not be correct as it has probably not completed processing.   

Standard accounts that send more than 200,000 sessions per day to Analytics will result in the reports being refreshed only once a day. This can delay updates to reports and metrics for up to two days. To restore intra-day processing, reduce the number of sessions your account sends to < 200,000 per day. For Analytics 360 accounts, this limit is extended to 2 billion hits per month.
