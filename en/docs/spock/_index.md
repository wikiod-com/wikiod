Spock is a testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy applications. It uses an expressive specification language. 

A developer, usually a [Java][1] developer using [groovy][2], may use Spock as specification driven checking (testing) framework. A tester may use Spock to write functional checks of software package allowing the full power of [groovy][2].

It basically allows you to write specifications that describe expected features.
