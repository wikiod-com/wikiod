This topic contains information about customizing the look, feel, and functionality of Terminal.

Terminal is easy to customize. Most terminal customization is available through both Terminal > Preferences graphically, and by using terminal commands.

The terminal preferences window contains 4 tabs, which are explained below.

## Terminal Customization Tabs
Found under `Terminal > Preferences`

**General** 

In the general tab, you can chose which profile is opened when you start terminal. You can set "Shells open with" to chose which directory terminal opens to, or specify a command to run each time you open a new terminal window or tab. 

**Profiles** 

The profiles tab allows you to customize the look and feel of your terminal. It comes with a bunch of pre set themes, each of which can be customized further to your liking. Profiles includes sub tabs for changing settings like Text, Window, Tab, Shell, Keyboard, and Advanced. 



**Window Groups** 

Window groups are configurable layouts that are used to organized multiple terminal windows. To set a window group, use `Window > Save Windows as Group`. This will allow you to save your current terminal layout as a "Window Group". 

**Encodings** 

In the encodings tab, you can select which encodings you want to show up when choosing options in the text encoding menus. For most users, the default is fine here.
