Terminal is the built in terminal emulator that is default on Apple computers.

Terminal grants the user access to the Command Line Interface (CLI) of macOS. Written in C and Objective C, terminal has been developed to be highly customizable. Users can chose to use a variety of different shells in terminal, and can customize terminals look and feel in `Terminal > Preferences`.

Terminal users have access to special commands that interact with the macOS API's, as well as familiar unix commands.
