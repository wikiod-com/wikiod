Cocoapods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective C projects. As stated from the [official site](https://cocoapods.org/), it has over 28 thousand libraries and is used in over 1.7 million apps. It can make developers develop faster by using third party libraries. Cocoapods makes managing dependencies in your code easier. Adding and removing dependencies can be done by writing them in a file (called the podfile) and running it.
