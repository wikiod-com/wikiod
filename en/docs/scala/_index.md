Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of [object-oriented][1] and [functional][2] languages.

Most given examples require a working Scala installation. [This is the Scala installation page][3], and this is the ['How to setup Scala'][4] example.
[scalafiddle.net][5] is a good resource for executing small code examples over the web.
