## Installation or Setup
Detailed instructions on getting ironpython set up or installed.

# Install IronPython

Just download the newest version from http://ironpython.net and follow the instructions from the msi package. This package will setup everything you need to start working with ironpython.

## Using the IronPython command line
To use the IronPython command line, open `ipy.exe` or `ipy64.exe`. Both files are located in the path that was selected during installation. By default they will be located at `C:\Program Files\IronPython 2.7\`.

Then start writing your statements directly in the IronPython command line.

For example:
    print 'Hello World'

OR

For ironpython 3:
    print ('Hello World')
