## Installation or Setup
Time complexity is a property of
- **Problems** someone might want to solve computationally,
- **Algorithms** designed to solve such problems and
- **Programs** implementing such algorithms.

An abstract concept requires no installation or setup. Simply take any problem, algorithm, or code and ask "How long will this take?‚Äù

## Hello, world!
<!-- language: lang-sh -->

    echo "Hello, world!"

Even in bash, this program works similarly in most other languages. The program has no input and will always function the same in an idealized world - run time should never change. Thus Hello World has *constant complexity*.

Almost all elementary operations are assumed to have constant complexity. This forms the basic building blocks of most programs.
