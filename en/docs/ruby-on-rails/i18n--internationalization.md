## Syntax
- I18n.t("key")
- I18n.translate("key")  # equivalent to `I18n.t("key")`
- I18n.t("key", count: 4)
- I18n.t("key", param1: "Something", param2: "Else")
- I18n.t("doesnt_exist", default: "key")  # specify a default if the key is missing
- I18n.locale #=> :en
- I18n.locale = :en
- I18n.default_locale #=> :en
- I18n.default_locale = :en
- t(".key")  # same as `I18n.t("key")`, but scoped to the action/template it's called from


## I18n with arguments
You can pass parameters to **I18n** `t` method:

    # Example config/locales/en.yml
    en:
      page:
        users: "%{users_count} users currently online"

    # In models, controller, etc...
    I18n.t('page.users', users_count: 12)
    
    # In views

    # ERB
    <%= t('page.users', users_count: 12) %>

    #SLIM
    = t('page.users', users_count: 12)

    # Shortcut in views - DRY!
    # Use only the dot notation
    # Important: Consider you have the following controller and view page#users
    
    # ERB Example app/views/page/users.html.erb
    <%= t('.users', users_count: 12) %>

And get the following output:

    "12 users currently online"

## Translating ActiveRecord model attributes
**`globalize`** gem is a great solution to add translations to your `ActiveRecord` models. You can install it adding this to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'globalize', '~> 5.0.0'
If you're using `Rails 5` you will also need to add `activemodel-serializers-xml`

    gem 'activemodel-serializers-xml'

Model translations allow you to translate your models' attribute values, for example:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      translates :title, :text
    end

    I18n.locale = :en
    post.title # => Globalize rocks!

    I18n.locale = :he
    post.title # => גלובאלייז2 שולט!

After you defined your model attributes that need to be translated you have to create a translation table, through a migration. **`globalize`** provides `create_translation_table!` and `drop_translation_table!`.

For this migration you need to use `up` and `down`, and **not** `change`. Also, in order to run this migration successfully, you have to define the translated attributes in your model first, like shown above. A proper migration for the previous `Post` model is this:

    class CreatePostsTranslationTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def up
        Post.create_translation_table! title: :string, text: :text
      end

      def down
        Post.drop_translation_table!
      end
    end

You may also pass options for specific options, like:

    class CreatePostsTranslationTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def up
        Post.create_translation_table! title: :string,
          text: { type: :text, null: false, default: "Default text" }
      end

      def down
        Post.drop_translation_table!
      end
    end

In case you already have any **existing data** in your needing translation columns, you can easily migrate it to the translations table, by adjusting your migration:

    class CreatePostsTranslationTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def up
        Post.create_translation_table!({
          title: :string,
          text: :text
        }, {
          migrate_data: true
        })
          
      end

      def down
        Post.drop_translation_table! migrate_data: true
      end
    end

**_Make sure you drop the translated columns from the parent table after all your data is safely migrated._** To automatically remove the translated columns from the parent table after the data migration, add the option `remove_source_columns` to the migration:

    class CreatePostsTranslationTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def up
        Post.create_translation_table!({
          title: :string,
          text: :text
        }, {
          migrate_data: true,
          remove_source_columns: true
        })
          
      end

      def down
        Post.drop_translation_table! migrate_data: true
      end
    end

You may also add new fields to a previously created translations table:

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      # Remember to add your attribute here too.
      translates :title, :text, :author
    end

    class AddAuthorToPost < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def up
        Post.add_translation_fields! author: :text
      end

      def down
        remove_column :post_translations, :author
      end
    end

## Pluralization
You can let **I18n** handle pluralization for you, just use `count` argument.

You need to set up your locale file like this:

    # config/locales/en.yml
    en:
      online_users:
        one: "1 user is online"
        other: "%{count} users are online"

And then use the key you just created by passing the `count` argument to `I18n.t` helper:

    I18n.t("online_users", count: 1)
    #=> "1 user is online"

    I18n.t("online_users", count: 4)
    #=> "4 users are online"

    

## Set locale through requests
In most cases, you may want to set **`I18n`** locale. One might want to set the locale for the current session, the current user, or based on a URL parameter This is easily achievable by implementing a `before_action` in one of your controllers, or in `ApplicationController` to have it in all of your controllers.

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      before_action :set_locale

      protected

      def set_locale
        # Remove inappropriate/unnecessary ones
        I18n.locale = params[:locale] ||    # Request parameter
          session[:locale] ||               # Current session
          (current_user.preferred_locale if user_signed_in?) ||  # Model saved configuration
          extract_locale_from_accept_language_header ||          # Language header - browser config
          I18n.default_locale               # Set in your config files, english by super-default
      end

      # Extract language from request header
      def extract_locale_from_accept_language_header
        if request.env['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE']
          lg = request.env['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'].scan(/^[a-z]{2}/).first.to_sym
          lg.in?([:en, YOUR_AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES]) ? lg : nil
        end
      end

# URL-based

The `locale` param could come from an URL like this

    http://yourapplication.com/products?locale=en

Or

    http://yourapplication.com/en/products

To achieve the latter, you need to edit your `routes`, adding a `scope`:

    # config/routes.rb
    scope "(:locale)", locale: /en|fr/ do
      resources :products
    end

By doing this, visiting `http://yourapplication.com/en/products` will set your locale to `:en`. Instead, visiting `http://yourapplication.com/fr/products` will set it to `:fr`. Furthermore, you won't get a routing error when missing the `:locale` param, as visiting `http://yourapplication.com/products` will load the default **I18n** locale.

# Session-based or persistence-based

This assumes the user can click on a button/language flag to change the language. The action can route to a controller that sets the session to the current language (and eventually persist the changes to a database if the user is connected)

    class SetLanguageController < ApplicationController
      skip_before_filter :authenticate_user!
      after_action :set_preferred_locale

      # Generic version to handle a large list of languages
      def change_locale
        I18n.locale = sanitize_language_param
        set_session_and_redirect
      end

>You have to define sanitize_language_param with your list of available languages, and eventually handle errors in case the language doesn't exist.

If you have very few languages, it may be worth defining them like this instead:

    def fr
      I18n.locale = :fr
      set_session_and_redirect
    end

    def en
      I18n.locale = :en
      set_session_and_redirect
    end

    private

      def set_session_and_redirect
        session[:locale] = I18n.locale
        redirect_to :back
      end

      def set_preferred_locale
        if user_signed_in?
          current_user.preferred_locale = I18n.locale.to_s
          current_user.save if current_user.changed?
        end
      end
    end

_Note: don't forget to add some routes to your `change_language` actions_

# Default Locale

Remember that you need to set your application default locale. You can do it by either setting it in `config/application.rb`:

    config.i18n.default_locale = :de

or by creating an initializer in the `config/initializers` folder:

    # config/initializers/locale.rb
    I18n.default_locale = :it

## Get locale from HTTP request
Sometimes it can be useful to set your application locale based upon the request IP. You can easily achieve this using **`Geocoder`**. Among the many things **`Geocoder`** does, it can also tell the `location` of a `request`.

First, add **`Geocoder`** to your `Gemfile`
    
    # Gemfile
    gem 'geocoder'

**`Geocoder`**  adds `location` and `safe_location` methods to the standard `Rack::Request` object so you can easily look up the location of any HTTP request by IP address. You can use this methods in a `before_action` in your `ApplicationController`:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      before_action :set_locale_from_request

      def set_locale_from_request
        country_code = request.location.data["country_code"] #=> "US"
        country_sym = country_code.underscore.to_sym #=> :us

        # If request locale is available use it, otherwise use I18n default locale
        if I18n.available_locales.include? country_sym
          I18n.locale = country_sym
        end
    end

Beware that this will not work in `development` and `test` environments, as things like `0.0.0.0` and `localhost` are valid valid Internet IP addresses.

# Limitations and alternatives
**`Geocoder`** is very powerful and flexible, but needs to be configured to work with a *geocoding service* (see [more details][1]); many of which place limits on usage. It's also worth bearing in mind that calling an external service on every request could impact performance.

To address these, it can also be worth considering:

## 1. An offline solution

Using a gem like **`GeoIP`** (see [here][2]) allows lookups to happen against a local datafile. There may be a trade-off in terms of accuracy, as these datafiles need to be kept up-to-date.

## 2. Use CloudFlare

Pages served through CloudFlare have the option of being geocoded transparently, with the country code being added to the header (`HTTP_CF_IPCOUNTRY`). More detail can be found [here][3].

## Use I18n with HTML Tags and Symbols
    # config/locales/en.yml
    en:
      stackoverflow:
        header:
          title_html: "Use <strong>I18n</strong> with Tags &amp; Symbols"

Note the addition of extra `_html` after the name `title`.

And in Views,

    # ERB
    <h2><%= t(:title_html, scope: [:stackoverflow, :header]) %></h2>

## Use I18n in views
Assuming you have this YAML locale file:

    # config/locales/en.yml
    en:
      header:
        title: "My header title"

and you want to display your title string, you can do this

    # in ERB files
    <%= t('header.title') %>
    
    # in SLIM files
    = t('header.title')
