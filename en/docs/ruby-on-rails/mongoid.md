## Fields
As per the [Mongoid Documentation][1], there are 16 valid field types:

 - Array 
 - BigDecimal
 - Boolean 
 - Date
 - DateTime
 - Float
 - Hash
 - Integer
 - BSON::ObjectId
 - BSON::Binary
 - Range
 - Regexp
 - String
 - Symbol
 - Time
 - TimeWithZone

To add a field (let's call it `name` and have it be a `String`), add this to your model file:

    field :name, type: String

To set a default value, just pass in the `default` option:

    field :name, type: String, default: ""

## Installation
First, add `Mongoid` to your `Gemfile`:

    gem "mongoid", "~> 4.0.0"
and then run `bundle install`. Or just run:

    $ gem install mongoid

After installation, run the generator to create the config file:

    $ rails g mongoid:config

which will create the file `(myapp)/config/mongoid.yml`.

## Creating a Model
Create a model (lets call it `User`) by running:

    $ rails g model User

which will generate the file `app/models/user.rb`:

    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
   
    end

This is all you need to have a model (albeit nothing but an `id` field). Unlike `ActiveRecord`, there is no migration files. All the database information for the model is contained in the model file.

Timestamps are not automatically included in your model when you generate it. To add `created_at` and `updated_at` to your model, add

    include Mongoid::Timestamps

to your model underneath `include Mongoid::Document` like so:

    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::Timestamps

    end

## Classic Associations
Mongoid allows the classic `ActiveRecord` associations:

 - One-to-one: `has_one` / `belongs_to`
 - One-to-many: `has_many` / `belongs_to`
 - Many-to-many: `has_and_belongs_to_many`

To add an association (lets say the User `has_many` posts), you can add this to your `User` model file:

    has_many :posts

and this to your `Post` model file:

    belongs_to :user

This will add a `user_id` field in your `Post` model, add a `user` method to your `Post` class, and add a `posts` method to your `User` class.

## Embedded Associations
Mongoid allows Embedded Associations:

 - One-to-one: `embeds_one` / `embedded_in`
 - One-to-many: `embeds_many` / `embedded_in`

To add an association (lets say the User `embeds_many` addresses), add this to your `User` file:

    embeds_many :addresses

and this to your `Address` model file:

    embedded_in :user

This will embed `Address` in your `User` model, adding a `addresses` method to your `User` class.

## Database Calls
Mongoid tries to have similar syntax to `ActiveRecord` when it can. It supports these calls (and many more)

    User.first #Gets first user from the database

    User.count #Gets the count of all users from the database

    User.find(params[:id]) #Returns the user with the id found in params[:id]

    User.where(name: "Bob") #Returns a Mongoid::Criteria object that can be chained
                            #with other queries (like another 'where' or an 'any_in')
                            #Does NOT return any objects from database

    User.where(name: "Bob").entries #Returns all objects with name "Bob" from database

    User.where(:name.in => ['Bob', 'Alice']).entries #Returns all objects with name "Bob" or "Alice" from database

    User.any_in(name: ["Bob", "Joe"]).first #Returns the first object with name "Bob" or "Joe"
    User.where(:name => 'Bob').exists? # will return true if there is one or more users with name bob
