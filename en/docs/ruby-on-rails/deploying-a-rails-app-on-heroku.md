## Deploying your application
Make sure you are in the directory that contains your Rails app, then create an app on Heroku.

<!-- language: lang-none -->
    $ heroku create example
    Creating ⬢ example... done
    https://example.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/example.git

The first URL of the ouput, http://example.herokuapp.com, is the location the app is available at. The second URL, git@heroku.com:example.git, is the remote git repository URL.

This command should only be used on an initialized git repository. The heroku create command automatically adds a git remote named “heroku” pointing at this URL.

The app name argument (“example”) is optional. If no app name is specified, a random name will be generated. Since Heroku app names are in a global namespace, you can expect that common names, like “blog” or “wiki”, will already be taken. It’s often easier to start with a default name and rename the app later.

Next, deploy your code:

    $ git push heroku master

If you are using the database in your application you need to manually migrate the database by running:

    $ heroku run rake db:migrate

Any commands after `heroku run` will be executed on a Heroku dyno. You can obtain an interactive shell session by running:

    $ heroku run bash

Ensure you have one dyno running the web process type:

    $ heroku ps:scale web=1

The heroku ps command lists the running dynos of your application:

    $ heroku ps
    === web (Standard-1X): bin/rails server -p $PORT -e $RAILS_ENV (1)
    web.1: starting 2016/07/08 12:09:06 -0500 (~ 2s ago)

You can now visit the app in our browser with `heroku open`.

    $ heroku open

Heroku gives you a default web URL in the `herokuapp.com` domain. When you are ready to scale up for production, you can add your own custom domain.

## Managing Production and staging environments for a Heroku
Every Heroku app runs in at least two environments: on Heroku (we’ll call that production) and on your local machine (development). If more than one person is working on the app, then you’ve got multiple development environments - one per machine, usually. Usually, each developer will also have a test environment for running tests. Unfortunately, this approach breaks down as the environments become less similar. Windows and Macs, for instance, both provide different environments than the Linux stack on Heroku, so you can’t always be sure that code that works in your local development environment will work the same way when you deploy it to production.

The solution is to have a staging environment that is as similar to production as is possible. This can be achieved by creating a second Heroku application that hosts your staging application. With staging, you can check your code in a production-like setting before having it affect your actual users. 

**Starting from scratch**

Assume you have an application running on your local machine, and you’re ready to push it to Heroku. We’ll need to create both remote environments, staging and production. To get in the habit of pushing to staging first, we’ll start with this:

    $ heroku create --remote staging
    Creating strong-river-216.... done
    http://strong-river-216.heroku.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/strong-river-216.git
    Git remote staging added

By default, the heroku CLI creates projects with a heroku git remote. Here, we’re specifying a different name with the --remote flag, so pushing code to Heroku and running commands against the app look a little different than the normal git push heroku master:

     $ git push staging master
    ...
     $ heroku ps --remote staging
    === web: `bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb``
    web.1: up for 21s

Once your staging app is up and running properly, you can create your production app:

    $ heroku create --remote production
    Creating fierce-ice-327.... done
    http://fierce-ice-327.heroku.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/fierce-ice-327.git
    Git remote production added
    $ git push production master
    ...
    $ heroku ps --remote production
    === web: `bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb
    web.1: up for 16s

And with that, you’ve got the same codebase running as two separate Heroku apps – one staging and one production, set up identically. Just remember you will have to specify which app you are going to operate on your daily work. You can either use flag '--remote' or use your git config to specify a default app.
