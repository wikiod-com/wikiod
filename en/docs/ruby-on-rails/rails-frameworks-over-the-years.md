When you're new to Rails and working on legacy Rails applications, it can be confusing to understand which framework was introduced when. This topic is designed to be the *definitive* list of all frameworks across Rails versions.

## How to find what frameworks are available in the current version of Rails?
Use the

> config.frameworks

option to get an array of <code>Symbol</code>s that represent each framework.
