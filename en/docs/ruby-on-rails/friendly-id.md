FriendlyId is the "Swiss Army bulldozer" of slugging and permalink plugins for Active Record. It lets you create pretty URLs and work with human-friendly strings as if they were numeric ids.
With FriendlyId, it's easy to make your application use URLs like:

http://example.com/states/washington





## Rails Quickstart
    rails new my_app
    cd my_app
# Gemfile
    gem 'friendly_id', '~> 5.1.0' # Note: You MUST use 5.0.0 or greater for Rails 4.0+
    rails generate friendly_id
    rails generate scaffold user name:string slug:string:uniq
    rake db:migrate
# edit app/models/user.rb
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      extend FriendlyId
      friendly_id :name, use: :slugged
    end

    User.create! name: "Joe Schmoe"

    # Change User.find to User.friendly.find in your controller
    User.friendly.find(params[:id])
#
    rails server
    GET http://localhost:3000/users/joe-schmoe

#
    # If you're adding FriendlyId to an existing app and need
    # to generate slugs for existing users, do this from the
    # console, runner, or add a Rake task:
    User.find_each(&:save)
    
    Finders are no longer overridden by default. If you want to do friendly finds, you must do Model.friendly.find rather than Model.find. You can however restore FriendlyId 4-style finders by using the :finders addon


    friendly_id :foo, use: :slugged # you must do MyClass.friendly.find('bar')
    #or...
    friendly_id :foo, use: [:slugged, :finders] # you can now do MyClass.find('bar')

A new "candidates" functionality which makes it easy to set up a list of alternate slugs that can be used to uniquely distinguish records, rather than appending a sequence. For example:

    class Restaurant < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend FriendlyId
      friendly_id :slug_candidates, use: :slugged
    
      # Try building a slug based on the following fields in
      # increasing order of specificity.
      def slug_candidates
        [
          :name,
          [:name, :city],
          [:name, :street, :city],
          [:name, :street_number, :street, :city]
        ]
      end
    end
Set slug limit length using friendly_id gem?

    def normalize_friendly_id(string)
       super[0..40]
    end
