The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.


"Routing" in general is how URL's are "handled" by your app.  In Rails case it's typically which controller and which action of that controller will handle a particular incoming URL.  In Rails apps, routes are usually placed in the `config/routes.rb` file.

## Resource Routing (Basic)
Routes are defined in `config/routes.rb`. They are often defined as a group of related routes, using the [`resources`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/Mapper/Resources.html#method-i-resources) or [`resource`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/Mapper/Resources.html#method-i-resource) methods.

`resources :users` creates the following seven routes, all mapping to actions of `UsersController`:

<!-- language: lang-none -->

    get       '/users',          to: 'users#index'
    post      '/users',          to: 'users#create'
    get       '/users/new',      to: 'users#new'
    get       '/users/:id/edit', to: 'users#edit'
    get       '/users/:id',      to: 'users#show'
    patch/put '/users/:id',      to: 'users#update'
    delete    '/users/:id',      to: 'users#destroy'

Action names are shown after the `#` in the `to` parameter above. Methods with those same names must be defined in `app/controllers/users_controller.rb` as follows:

<!-- language: lang-rb -->

    class UsersController < ApplicationController
      def index
      end

      def create
      end

      # continue with all the other methodsâ€¦
    end

You can limit the actions that gets generated with `only` or `except`:

<!-- language: lang-rb -->
    resources :users, only:   [:show]
    resources :users, except: [:show, :index]

You can view all the routes of your application at any given time by running: 

<!-- if version [lt 5.0] -->
    $ rake routes
<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [gte 5.0] -->
    $ rake routes
    # OR
    $ rails routes
<!-- end version if -->

<!-- language: lang-none -->
    users     GET    /users(.:format)          users#index
              POST   /users(.:format)          users#create
    new_user  GET    /users/new(.:format)      users#new
    edit_user GET    /users/:id/edit(.:format) users#edit
    user      GET    /users/:id(.:format)      users#show
              PATCH  /users/:id(.:format)      users#update
              PUT    /users/:id(.:format)      users#update
              DELETE /users/:id(.:format)      users#destroy

To see only the routes that map to a particular controller:

<!-- if version [lt 5.0] -->

<!-- language: lang-none -->
    $ rake routes -c static_pages
    static_pages_home    GET    /static_pages/home(.:format)    static_pages#home
    static_pages_help    GET    /static_pages/help(.:format)    static_pages#help
<!-- end version if -->
<!-- if version [gte 5.0] -->

<!-- language: lang-none -->
    $ rake routes -c static_pages
    static_pages_home    GET    /static_pages/home(.:format)    static_pages#home
    static_pages_help    GET    /static_pages/help(.:format)    static_pages#help

    # OR

    $ rails routes -c static_pages
    static_pages_home    GET    /static_pages/home(.:format)    static_pages#home
    static_pages_help    GET    /static_pages/help(.:format)    static_pages#help
<!-- end version if -->

You can search through routes using the `-g` option. This shows any route that partially matches the helper method name, the URL path or the HTTP verb:

<!-- if version [lt 5.0] -->
    $ rake routes -g new_user     # Matches helper method
    $ rake routes -g POST         # Matches HTTP Verb POST 
<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [gte 5.0] -->
    $ rake routes -g new_user     # Matches helper method
    $ rake routes -g POST         # Matches HTTP Verb POST 
    # OR
    $ rails routes -g new_user    # Matches helper method
    $ rails routes -g POST        # Matches HTTP Verb POST 
<!-- end version if -->
Additionally, when running `rails` server in development mode, you can access a web page that shows all your routes with a search filter, matched in priority from top to bottom,  at `<hostname>/rails/info/routes`. It will look like this:

 Helper|HTTP Verb|Path|Controller#Action
 ---|---|---|---
 Path / Url | | [ Path Match ]
 users_path|GET|/users(.:format)|users#index
  |POST|/users(.:format)|users#create
 new_user_path|GET|/users/new(.:format)|users#new
 edit_user_path|GET|/users/:id/edit(.:format)|users#edit
 user_path|GET|/users/:id(.:format)|users#show
  |PATCH|/users/:id(.:format)|users#update
  |PUT|/users/:id(.:format)|users#update
  |DELETE|/users/:id(.:format)|users#destroy

Routes can be declared available for only members (not collections) using the method `resource` instead of `resources` in `routes.rb`. With `resource`, an `index` route is not created by default, but only when explicitly asking for one like this:

    resource :orders, only: [:index, :create, :show]


## Constraints
You can filter what routes are available using constraints. 

There are several ways to use constraints including:
* [segment constraints][1], 
* [request based constraints][2] 
* [advanced constraints][3]

For example, a requested based constraint to only allow a specific IP address to access a route:

    constraints(ip: /127\.0\.0\.1$/) do
      get 'route', to: "controller#action"
    end

[See other similar examples ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper::Scoping][4].



If you want to do something more complex you can use more advanced constraints and create a class to wrap the logic:

    # lib/api_version_constraint.rb
    class ApiVersionConstraint
      def initialize(version:, default:)
        @version = version
        @default = default
      end

      def version_header
        "application/vnd.my-app.v#{@version}"
      end

      def matches?(request)
        @default || request.headers["Accept"].include?(version_header)
      end
    end

    # config/routes.rb
    require "api_version_constraint"
    
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      namespace :v1, constraints: ApiVersionConstraint.new(version: 1, default: true) do
        resources :users # Will route to app/controllers/v1/users_controller.rb
      end

      namespace :v2, constraints: ApiVersionConstraint.new(version: 2) do
        resources :users # Will route to app/controllers/v2/users_controller.rb
      end
    end

**One form, several submit buttons**

You can also use the value of the submit tags of a form as a constraint to route to a different action. If you have a form with multiple submit buttons (eg "preview" and "submit"), you could capture this constraint directly in your `routes.rb`, instead of writing javascript to change the form destination URL. For example with the [commit_param_routing][5] gem you can take advantage of rails `submit_tag`

Rails `submit_tag` first parameter lets you change the value of your form commit parameter

    # app/views/orders/mass_order.html.erb
    <%= form_for(@orders, url: mass_create_order_path do |f| %>
        <!-- Big form here -->
      <%= submit_tag "Preview" %>
      <%= submit_tag "Submit" %>
      # => <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Preview" />
      # => <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Submit" />
      ...
    <% end %>

    # config/routes.rb
    resources :orders do
      # Both routes below describe the same POST URL, but route to different actions 
      post 'mass_order', on: :collection, as: 'mass_order',
        constraints: CommitParamRouting.new('Submit'), action: 'mass_create' # when the user presses "submit"
      post 'mass_order', on: :collection,
        constraints: CommitParamRouting.new('Preview'), action: 'mass_create_preview' # when the user presses "preview"
      # Note the `as:` is defined only once, since the path helper is mass_create_order_path for the form url
      # CommitParamRouting is just a class like ApiVersionContraint
    end

## Scoping routes
Rails provides several ways to organize your routes.

**Scope by URL**: 

    scope 'admin' do
      get 'dashboard', to: 'administration#dashboard'
      resources 'employees'
    end

This generates the following routes

    get       '/admin/dashboard',          to: 'administration#dashboard'
    post      '/admin/employees',          to: 'employees#create'
    get       '/admin/employees/new',      to: 'employees#new'
    get       '/admin/employees/:id/edit', to: 'employees#edit'
    get       '/admin/employees/:id',      to: 'employees#show'
    patch/put '/admin/employees/:id',      to: 'employees#update'
    delete    '/admin/employees/:id',      to: 'employees#destroy'

It may make more sense, on the server side, to keep some views in a different subfolder, to separate admin views from user views. 

**Scope by module**

    scope module: :admin do
      get 'dashboard', to: 'administration#dashboard'
    end

`module` looks for the controller files under the subfolder of the given name

    get       '/dashboard',          to: 'admin/administration#dashboard'

You can rename the path helpers prefix by adding an `as` parameter

    scope 'admin', as: :administration do
      get 'dashboard'
    end

    # => administration_dashboard_path

Rails provides a convenient way to do all the above, using the `namespace` method. The following declarations are equivalent

    namespace :admin do
    end

    scope 'admin', module: :admin, as: :admin

**Scope by controller**

    scope controller: :management do
      get 'dashboard'
      get 'performance'
    end

This generate these routes

    get       '/dashboard',          to: 'management#dashboard'
    get       '/performance',        to: 'management#performance'

**Shallow Nesting**

Resource routes accept a `:shallow` option that helps to shorten URLs where possible. Resources shouldn't be nested more than one level deep. One way to avoid this is by creating shallow routes. The goal is to leave off parent collection URL segments where they are not needed. The end result is that the only nested routes generated are for the `:index` , `:create` , and `:new` actions. The rest are kept in their own shallow URL context. There are two options for scope to custom shallow routes:

* **:shallow_path**: Prefixes member paths with a specified parameter
    
      scope shallow_path: "sekret" do
        resources :articles do
          resources :comments, shallow: true
        end
      end
* **:shallow_prefix**: Add specified parameters to named helpers

      scope shallow_prefix: "sekret" do
        resources :articles do
          resources :comments, shallow: true
        end
      end


We can also illustrate `shallow` routes more by:

    resources :auctions, shallow: true do
      resources :bids do
       resources :comments
      end
    end 

alternatively coded as follows (if youâ€™re block-happy):

    resources :auctions do
     shallow do
       resources :bids do
         resources :comments
       end
     end
    end

The resulting routes are:

| Prefix | Verb | URI Pattern |  
| :------ | :------ | :----- |
| bid_comments   | GET   | /bids/:bid_id/comments(.:format)
|                | POST  | /bids/:bid_id/comments(.:format)
| new_bid_comment| GET   | /bids/:bid_id/comments/new(.:format)
| edit_comment   | GET   | /comments/:id/edit(.:format)
| comment        | GET   | /comments/:id(.:format)
|                | PATCH | /comments/:id(.:format)
|                | PUT   | /comments/:id(.:format)
|                | DELETE| /comments/:id(.:format)
| auction_bids   | GET   | /auctions/:auction_id/bids(.:format)
|                | POST  | /auctions/:auction_id/bids(.:format)
| new_auction_bid| GET   | /auctions/:auction_id/bids/new(.:format)
| edit_bid       | GET   | /bids/:id/edit(.:format)
| bid            | GET   | /bids/:id(.:format)
|                | PATCH | /bids/:id(.:format)
|                | PUT   | /bids/:id(.:format)
|                | DELETE| /bids/:id(.:format)
| auctions       | GET   | /auctions(.:format)
|                | POST  | /auctions(.:format)
| new_auction    | GET   | /auctions/new(.:format)
| edit_auction   | GET   | /auctions/:id/edit(.:format)
| auction        | GET   | /auctions/:id(.:format)
|                | PATCH | /auctions/:id(.:format)
|                | PUT   | /auctions/:id(.:format)
|                | DELETE| /auctions/:id(.:format)


If you analyze the routes generated carefully, youâ€™ll notice that the nested parts of the URL are only included when they are needed to determine what data to display.

## Concerns
To avoid repetition in nested routes, concerns provide a great way of sharing common resources that are reusable. To create a concern use the method `concern` within the `routes.rb` file.  The method expects a symbol and block:

    concern :commentable do
      resources :comments
    end

While not creating any routes itself, this code allows using the `:concerns` attribute on a resource.  The simplest example would be:

    resource :page, concerns: :commentable

The equivalent nested resource would look like this:

    resource :page do
      resource :comments
    end

This would build, for example, the following routes:

    /pages/#{page_id}/comments
    /pages/#{page_id}/comments/#{comment_id}

For concerns to be meaningful, there must be multiple resources that utilize the concern.  Additional resources could use any of the following syntax to call the concern:

    resource :post, concerns: %i(commentable)
    resource :blog do
      concerns :commentable
    end


## Root route
You can add a home page route to your app with the `root` method.

```
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root "application#index"
  # equivalent to:
  # get "/", "application#index"  
end

# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  def index
    render "homepage"
  end
end
```

And in terminal, `rake routes` (`rails routes` in Rails 5) will produce:
```
root     GET    /         application#index
```

Because the homepage is usually the most important route, and routes are prioritized in the order they appear, the `root` route should usually be the first in your routes file.

## Additional RESTful actions
```ruby
resources :photos do
  member do
    get 'preview'
  end
  collection do
    get 'dashboard'
  end
end
````

This creates the following routes **in addition to default 7 RESTful routes**:

```
get       '/photos/:id/preview',          to: 'photos#preview'
get       '/photos/dashboards',           to: 'photos#dashboard'
```

If you want to do this for single lines, you can use:

```ruby
resources :photos do
  get 'preview',   on: :member
  get 'dashboard', on: :collection
end
```

You can also add an action to the `/new` path:

```ruby
resources :photos do
  get 'preview', on: :new
end
```

Which will create:

```
get       '/photos/new/preview',          to: 'photos#preview'
```

Be mindful when adding actions to your RESTful routes, probably you are missing another resource!

## Split routes into multiple files
If your routes file is overwhelmingly big, you can put your routes in multiple files and include each of the files with Rubyâ€™s [`require_relative`](http://apidock.com/ruby/Kernel/require_relative) method:

#### `config/routes.rb`:

```
YourAppName::Application.routes.draw do
  require_relative 'routes/admin_routes'
  require_relative 'routes/sidekiq_routes'
  require_relative 'routes/api_routes'
  require_relative 'routes/your_app_routes'
end
```

#### `config/routes/api_routes.rb`:

```
YourAppName::Application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    # ...
  end
end
```


## Member and Collection Routes
Defining a member block inside a resource creates a route that can act on an individual member of that resource-based route:

    resources :posts do
      member do
        get 'preview'
      end
    end

This generates the following member route:

    get '/posts/:id/preview', to: 'posts#preview'
    # preview_post_path

Collection routes allow for creating routes that can act on a collection of resource objects:

    resources :posts do
      collection do
        get 'search'
      end
    end

This generates the following collection route:

    get '/posts/search', to: 'posts#search'
    # search_posts_path

An alternate syntax:

    resources :posts do
      get 'preview', on: :member
      get 'search',  on: :collection
    end

## Redirection
You can perform redirection in Rails routes as follows:

<!-- if version [gte 4.0] -->
    get '/stories', to: redirect('/posts')
<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [lt 4.0] -->
    match "/abc" => redirect("http://example.com/abc")
<!-- end version if -->

You can also redirect all unknown routes to a given path:

<!-- if version [gte 4.0] -->
    match '*path' => redirect('/'), via: :get
    # or
    get '*path' => redirect('/')
<!-- end version if -->

<!-- if version [lt 4.0] -->
    match '*path' => redirect('/')
<!-- end version if -->

## Mount another application
mount is used to mount another application (basically rack application) or rails engines to be used within the current application

**syntax:**

    mount SomeRackApp, at: "some_route"

Now you can access above mounted application using route helper `some_rack_app_path` or `some_rack_app_url`. 

But if you want to rename this helper name you can do it as:

    mount SomeRackApp, at: "some_route", as: :myapp

This will generate the `myapp_path` and `myapp_url` helpers which can be used to navigate to this mounted app.



## Nested Routes
If you want to add nested routes you can write the following code in `routes.rb` file.

    resources :admins do
      resources :employees
    end

This will generate following routes:

         admin_employees GET      /admins/:admin_id/employees(.:format)            employees#index
                         POST     /admins/:admin_id/employees(.:format)            employees#create
      new_admin_employee GET      /admins/:admin_id/employees/new(.:format)        employees#new
     edit_admin_employee GET      /admins/:admin_id/employees/:id/edit(.:format)   employees#edit
          admin_employee GET      /admins/:admin_id/employees/:id(.:format)        employees#show
                         PATCH    /admins/:admin_id/employees/:id(.:format)        employees#update
                         PUT      /admins/:admin_id/employees/:id(.:format)        employees#update
                         DELETE   /admins/:admin_id/employees/:id(.:format)        employees#destroy
                  admins GET      /admins(.:format)                                admins#index
                         POST     /admins(.:format)                                admins#create
               new_admin GET      /admins/new(.:format)                            admins#new
              edit_admin GET      /admins/:id/edit(.:format)                       admins#edit
                   admin GET      /admins/:id(.:format)                            admins#show
                         PATCH    /admins/:id(.:format)                            admins#update
                         PUT      /admins/:id(.:format)                            admins#update
                         DELETE   /admins/:id(.:format)                            admins#destroy

## Scope available locales
If your application is available in different languages, you usually show the current locale in the URL. 

    scope '/(:locale)', locale: /#{I18n.available_locales.join('|')}/ do
        root 'example#root'
        # other routes
    end

Your root will be accessible via the locales defined in `I18n.available_locales`.

## Redirects and Wildcard Routes
If you want to provide a URL out of convenience for your user but map it directly to another one you're already using. Use a redirect:

    # config/routes.rb
    TestApp::Application.routes.draw do
      get 'courses/:course_name' => redirect('/courses/%{course_name}/lessons'), :as => "course"
    end

Well, that got interesting fast. The basic principle here is to just use the `#redirect` method to send one route to another route. If your route is quite simple, it's a really straightforward method. But if you want to also send the original parameters, you need to do a bit of gymnastics by capturing the parameter inside `%{here}`. Note the single quotes around everything.

In the example above, we've also renamed the route for convenience by using an alias with the :as parameter. This lets us use that name in methods like the #_path helpers. Again, test out your `$ rake routes` with questions.



## URL params with a period
If you want to support a url parameter more complex than an id number, you may run into trouble with the parser if the value contains a period. Anything following a period will be assumed to be a format (i.e. json, xml).

You can work around this limitation by using a constraint to _broaden_ the accepted input.

For example, if you want to reference a user record by email address in the url:

```ruby
resources :users, constraints: { id: /.*/ }
```
