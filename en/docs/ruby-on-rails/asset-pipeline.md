The asset pipeline provides a framework to concatenate and minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets. It also adds the ability to write these assets in other languages and pre-processors such as CoffeeScript, Sass and ERB. It allows assets in your application to be automatically combined with assets from other gems. For example, jquery-rails includes a copy of jquery.js and enables AJAX features in Rails.

## Manifest Files and Directives
In the `assets` initalizer (`config/initializers/assets.rb`) are a few files explicitly defined to be precompiled.

    # Precompile additional assets.
    # application.coffee, application.scss, and all non-JS/CSS in app/assets folder are already added.
    # Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( search.js )

In this example the `application.coffee` and `application.scss` are so called 'Manifest Files'. This files should be used to include other JavaScript or CSS assets. The following command are available:

 - `require <path>`: The `require` directive functions similar to Ruby's own `require`. It provides a way to declare a dependency on a file in your path and ensures it's only loaded once before the source file.
 - `require_directory <path>`: requires all the files inside a single directory. It's similar to `path/*` since it does not follow nested directories.
 - `require_tree <path>`: requires all the nested files in a directory. Its glob equivalent is `path/**/*`.
 - `require_self`: causes the body of the current file to be inserted before any subsequent `require` directives. Useful in CSS files, where it's common for the index file to contain global styles that need to be defined before other dependencies are loaded.
 - `stub <path>`: remove a file from being included
 - `depend_on <path>`: Allows you to state a dependency on a file without including it.
This is used for caching purposes. Any changes made to the dependency file will invalidate the cache of the source file.

An `application.scss` file could look like:

    /*
     *= require bootstrap
     *= require_directory .
     *= require_self
     */

Another example is the `application.coffee` file. Here with including `jquery` and `Turbolinks`:

    #= require jquery2
    #= require jquery_ujs
    #= require turbolinks
    #= require_tree .

If you don't use CoffeeScript, but plain JavaScript, the syntax would be:

    //= require jquery2
    //= require jquery_ujs
    //= require turbolinks
    //= require_tree .



## Rake tasks
By default `sprockets-rails` is shipped with the following rake tasks:

 - `assets:clean[keep]`: Remove old compiled assets
 - `assets:clobber`: Remove compiled assets 
 - `assets:environment`: Load asset compile environment
 - `assets:precompile`: Compile all the assets named in `config.assets.precompile`


## Basic Usage
There are two basic ways that the asset pipeline is used:

 1. When running a server in development mode, it automatically pre-processes and prepares your assets on-the-fly.
 2. In production mode, youâ€™ll probably use it to pre-process, versionize, and compress and compile your assets. You can do so by running the following command:

    ```bundle exec rake assets:precompile```
