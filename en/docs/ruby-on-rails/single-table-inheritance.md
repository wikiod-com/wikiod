Single Table Inheritance (STI) is a design pattern which is based on the idea of saving the data of multiple models which are all inheriting from the same Base model, into a single table in the database.

## Basic example
First we need a table to hold our data

    class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        create_table :users do |t|
          t.string :name
          t.string :password
          t.string :type # <- This makes it an STI
    
          t.timestamps
        end
      end
    end


Then lets create some models

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
       validates_presence_of :password
       # This is a parent class. All shared logic goes here
    end

    class Admin < User
       # Admins must have more secure passwords than regular users
       # We can add it here
       validates :custom_password_validation
    end

    class Guest < User
       # Lets say that we have a guest type login. 
       # It has a static password that cannot be changed
       validates_inclusion_of :password, in: ['guest_password']
    end

When you do a `Guest.create(name: 'Bob')` ActiveRecord will translate this to create an entry in the Users table with `type: 'Guest'`.

When you retrieve the record `bob = User.where(name: 'Bob').first` the object returned will be an instance of `Guest`, which can be forcibly treated as a User with `bob.becomes(User)`

becomes is most useful when dealing with shared partials or routes/controllers of the superclass instead of the subclass.

## Custom inheritance column
By default STI model class name is stored in a column named `type`. But its name can be changed by overriding `inheritance_column` value in a base class. E.g.:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      self.inheritance_column = :entity_type # can be string as well
    end

    class Admin < User; end

Migration in this case will look as follows:

    class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        create_table :users do |t|
          t.string :name
          t.string :password
          t.string :entity_type
    
          t.timestamps
        end
      end
    end

When you do `Admin.create`, this record will be saved in the users table with `entity_type = "Admin"`


## Rails model with type column and without STI
Having `type` column in a Rails model without invoking STI can be achieved by assigning `:_type_disabled` to `inheritance_column`:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      self.inheritance_column = :_type_disabled
    end
