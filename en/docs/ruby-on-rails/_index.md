Ruby on Rails (RoR), or Rails, is an open-source popular web application framework.  Rails uses Ruby, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server.  Rails uses the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern and provides a fullstack of libraries from the database all the way to the view.
