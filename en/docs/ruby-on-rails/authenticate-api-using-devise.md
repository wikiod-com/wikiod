Devise is authentication solution for Rails. Before going any further i would like to add quick note on API. So API does not handle sessions (is stateless) which means one that provide response after you request, and then requires no further attention, which means no previous or future state is required for the system to work hence whenever we requesting to the server need to pass authentication details with all API and should tell Devise not to store authentication details.

## Getting Started
So first we will create rails project and setup device


create a rails application

    rails new devise_example

now add devise to gem list 

> you can find a file named 'Gemfile' at the root of rails project

Then run `bundle install`

Next, you need to run the generator:

    rails generate devise:install

Now on console you can find few instructions just follow it.

Generate devise model 

    rails generate devise MODEL


Then run `rake db:migrate`

For more details go to: [Devise Gem][1]

----------
## Authentication Token ##
Authentication token is used to authenticate a user with a unique token, So
Before we proceed with the logic first we need to add `auth_token` field to a Devise model

Hence,

    rails g migration add_authentication_token_to_users

    class AddAuthenticationTokenToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        add_column :users, :auth_token, :string, default: ""
        add_index :users, :auth_token, unique: true
      end
    end

Then run `rake db:migrate`

Now we are all set to do authentication using `auth_token` 

In `app/controllers/application_controllers.rb`

First this line to it

    respond_to :html, :json 

this will help rails application respond with both html and json

Then 

    protect_from_forgery with: :null

will change this `:null` as we are not dealing with sessions.

now we will add authentication method in application_controller

So, by default Devise uses email as unique field we can also use custom fields, for this case we will be authenticating using user_email and auth_token.  

      before_filter do
        user_email = params[:user_email].presence
        user       = user_email && User.find_by_email(user_email)

        if user && Devise.secure_compare(user.authentication_token, params[:auth_token])
          sign_in user, store: false
        end
      end
> Note: Above code is purely based on your logic i am just trying to explain the working example

On line 6 in the above code you can see that i have set `store: false` which will prevent from creating a session on each requests hence we achieved stateless re
