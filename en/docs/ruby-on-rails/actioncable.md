[ActionCable](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/actioncable) was available for Rails 4.x, and was bundled into Rails 5. It allows easy use of websockets for realtime communication between server and client.

## User Authentication
    # app/channels/application_cable/connection.rb
    module ApplicationCable
      class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
        identified_by :current_user
    
        def connect
          self.current_user = find_verified_user
          logger.add_tags 'ActionCable', current_user.id 
          # Can replace current_user.id with usernames, ids, emails etc.
        end
    
        protected
    
        def find_verified_user
          if verified_user = env['warden'].user
            verified_user
          else
            reject_unauthorized_connection
          end
        end
      end
    end
    

## [Basic] Server Side
    # app/channels/appearance_channel.rb
    class NotificationsChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
      def subscribed
        stream_from "notifications"
      end
    
      def unsubscribed
      end
    
      def notify(data)
        ActionCable.server.broadcast "notifications", { title: 'New things!', body: data }
      end
    end

## [Basic] Client Side (Coffeescript)
# app/assets/javascripts/channels/notifications.coffee
    App.notifications = App.cable.subscriptions.create "NotificationsChannel",
      connected: -> 
        # Called when the subscription is ready for use on the server
        $(document).on "change", "input", (e)=>
          @notify(e.target.value)
    
      disconnected: ->
        # Called when the subscription has been terminated by the server
         $(document).off "change", "input"
    
      received: (data) ->
        # Called when there's incoming data on the websocket for this channel
        $('body').append(data)

      notify: (data)->
        @perform('notify', data: data)
