[CanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) is a simple authorization strategy for Rails which is decoupled from user roles. All permissions are stored in a single location.




Before using CanCan don't forget to create Users either by devise gem or manually. To get maximum functionality of CanCan do create an Admin user.

## Getting started with CanCan
[CanCan][1] is a a popular authorization library for Ruby on Rails which restricts user access to specific resources. The latest gem (CanCanCan) is a continuation of the dead project [CanCan][2]. 

Permissions are defined in the `Ability` class and can be used from controllers, views, helpers, or any other place in the code.

To add authorization support to an app, add the CanCanCan gem to the `Gemfile`: 

    gem 'cancancan'

Then define the ability class: 

    # app/models/ability.rb
    class Ability
      include CanCan::Ability
    
      def initialize(user)
      end
    end

Then check authorization using `load_and_authorize_resource` to load authorized models into the controller:

    class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
      load_and_authorize_resource
    
      def show
        # @article is already loaded and authorized
      end
    end

`authorize!` to check authorization or raise an exception

    def show
      @article = Article.find(params[:id])
      authorize! :read, @article
    end

`can?` to check if an object is authorized against a particular action anywhere in the controllers, views, or helpers

    <% if can? :update, @article %>
      <%= link_to "Edit", edit_article_path(@article) %>
    <% end %>

**Note:** This assumes the signed user is provided by the `current_user` method.

## Handling large number of abilities
Once the number of abilities definitions start to grow in number, it becomes more and more difficult to handle the Ability file. 

The first strategy to handle these issue is to move abilities into meaningful methods, as per this example:

    class Ability
      include CanCan::Ability
    
      def initialize(user)
        anyone_abilities 

        if user
          if user.admin?
            admin_abilities
          else
            authenticated_abilities
          end
        else
          guest_abilities
        end
      end

      private
      
      def anyone_abilities
        # define abilities for everyone, both logged users and visitors
      end

      def guest_abilities
        # define abilities for visitors only
      end

      def authenticated_abilities
        # define abilities for logged users only
      end

      def admin_abilities
        # define abilities for admins only
      end
    end

Once this class grow large enough, you can try breaking it into different classes to handle the different responsibilities like this:

    # app/models/ability.rb
    class Ability
      include CanCan::Ability

      def initialize(user)
        self.merge Abilities::Everyone.new(user)
    
        if user
          if user.admin?
            self.merge Abilities::Admin.new(user)
          else
            self.merge Abilities::Authenticated.new(user)
          end
        else
          self.merge Abilities::Guest.new(user)
        end
      end
    end
    
and then define those classes as: 

    # app/models/abilities/guest.rb
    module Abilities
      class Guest
        include CanCan::Ability
    
        def initialize(user)
          # Abilities for anonymous visitors only
        end
      end
    end

and so on with `Abilities::Authenticated`, `Abilities::Admin` or any other else.

## Defining abilities
Abilities are defined in the `Ability` class using `can` and `cannot` methods. Consider the following commented example for basic reference:

    class Ability
      include CanCan::Ability
    
      def initialize(user)
        # for any visitor or user
        can :read, Article

        if user
          if user.admin?
            # admins can do any action on any model or action
            can :manage, :all
          else
            # regular users can read all content
            can :read, :all
            # and edit, update and destroy their own user only
            can [:edit, :destroy], User, id: user_id
            # but cannot read hidden articles
            cannot :read, Article, hidden: true
          end
        else
          # only unlogged visitors can visit a sign_up page:
          can :read, :sign_up
        end
      end
    end

## Quickly test an ability
If you'd like to quickly test if an ability class is giving the correct permissions, you can initialize an ability in the console or on another context with the rails environment loaded, just pass an user instance to test against: 

    test_ability = Ability.new(User.first)
    test_ability.can?(:show, Post) #=> true
    other_ability = Ability.new(RestrictedUser.first)
    other_ability.cannot?(:show, Post) #=> true
