ActiveRecord Transactions are protective blocks where sequence of active record queries are only permanent if they can all succeed as one atomic action.

## Getting Started with Active Record Transactions
Active Record Transactions can be applied to Model classes as well as Model instances, the objects within the transaction block need not all be instances of same class. This is because transactions are per-database connection, not per-model. For example: 

    User.transaction do
      account.save!
      profile.save!
      print "All saves success, returning 1"
      return 1
    end
    rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid do |exception|
      print "Exception thrown, transaction rolledback"
      render_error "failure", exception.record.errors.full_messages.to_sentence
    end
    
Using save with a bang ensures that transaction will be automatically rolled back when the exception is thrown and after the rollback, control goes to the rescue block for the exception. **Make sure you rescue the exceptions thrown from the save! in Transaction Block.**

If you don't want to use save!, you can manually raise `raise ActiveRecord::Rollback` when the save fails. You need not handle this exception. It will then rollback the transaction and take the control to the next statement after transaction block.

   

       User.transaction do
          if account.save && profile.save
            print "All saves success, returning 1"
            return 1
          else
            raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
          end
        end
        print "Transaction Rolled Back"
