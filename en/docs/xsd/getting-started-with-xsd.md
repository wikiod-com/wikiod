## Installation or Setup
XSD, XML Schema Definition, is a language which describes the structure of XML documents. XSD files can be used to validate an XML file. The process of doing this will depend on what you choose to implement it with. Care should be taken to ensure the validation engine you use is compatible with the desired version of XSD.
