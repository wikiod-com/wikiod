`React.createClass` [was deprecated in v15.5][1] and expected to be [removed in v16][2]. There is a [drop-in replacement package][3] for those that still require it.  Examples using it should be updated.

## Creating Components
This is an extension of Basic Example:

# Basic Structure

<!-- language: lang-js -->
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import { render } from 'react-dom';
    
    class FirstComponent extends Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    Hello, {this.props.name}! I am a FirstComponent.
                </div>
            );
        }
    }

    render(
        <FirstComponent name={ 'User' } />,
        document.getElementById('content')
    );


The above example is called a **stateless** component as it does not contain [state](https://www.wikiod.com/reactjs/state-in-react#Basic State) (in the React sense of the word).

In such a case, some people find it preferable to use Stateless Functional Components, which are based on [ES6 arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).

# Stateless Functional Components

In many applications there are smart components that hold state but render dumb components that simply receive props and return HTML as JSX. Stateless functional components are much more reusable and have a positive performance impact on your application.

They have 2 main characteristics:

1. When rendered they receive an object with all the props that were passed down
2. They must return the JSX to be rendered


<!-- language: lang-js -->
    // When using JSX inside a module you must import React
    import React from 'react';
    import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

    const FirstComponent = props => (
        <div>
            Hello, {props.name}! I am a FirstComponent.
        </div>
    );

    //arrow components also may have props validation
    FirstComponent.propTypes = {
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    }

    // To use FirstComponent in another file it must be exposed through an export call:
    export default FirstComponent;


# Stateful Components

In contrast to the 'stateless' components shown above, 'stateful' components have a state object that can be updated with the `setState` method. The state must be initialized in the `constructor` before it can be set:

<!-- language: lang-js -->
    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    class SecondComponent extends Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
    
            this.state = {
                toggle: true
            };
    
            // This is to bind context when passing onClick as a callback
            this.onClick = this.onClick.bind(this);
        }
    
        onClick() {
            this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
                toggle: !prevState.toggle
            }));
        }
        
        render() {
            return (
                <div onClick={this.onClick}>
                    Hello, {this.props.name}! I am a SecondComponent.
                    <br />
                    Toggle is: {this.state.toggle}
                </div>
            );
        }
    }

Extending a component with [`PureComponent`][1] instead of `Component` will automatically implement the `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method with shallow prop and state comparison. This keeps your application more performant by reducing the amount of un-necessary renders that occur. This assumes your components are 'Pure' and always render the same output with the same state and props input.

# Higher Order Components

Higher order components (HOC) allow to share component functionality.

<!-- language: lang-js -->
    import React, { Component } from 'react';

    const PrintHello = ComposedComponent => class extends Component {
        onClick() {
            console.log('hello');
        }
        
        /* The higher order component takes another component as a parameter 
        and then renders it with additional props */
        render() {
            return <ComposedComponent {...this.props } onClick={this.onClick} />
        }
    }

    const FirstComponent = props => (
        <div onClick={ props.onClick }>
            Hello, {props.name}! I am a FirstComponent.
        </div>
    );

    const ExtendedComponent = PrintHello(FirstComponent);

Higher order components are used when you want to share logic across several components regardless of how different they render.

## Basic Component
Given the following HTML file:

**index.html**

<!-- language: lang-html -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>React Tutorial</title>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.2.1/react.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.2.1/react-dom.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.34/browser.min.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="content"></div>
        <script type="text/babel" src="scripts/example.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>

You can create a basic component using the following code in a separate file:

**scripts/example.js**

<!-- language: lang-js -->
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

    class FirstComponent extends Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div className="firstComponent">
            Hello, world! I am a FirstComponent.
          </div>
        );
      }
    }
    ReactDOM.render(
      <FirstComponent />, // Note that this is the same as the variable you stored above
      document.getElementById('content')
    );


You will get the following result (note what is inside of `div#content`):

<!-- language: lang-html -->

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>React Tutorial</title>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.2.1/react.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/15.2.1/react-dom.js"></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/5.8.34/browser.min.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="content">
            <div className="firstComponent">
                Hello, world! I am a FirstComponent.
            </div>
        </div>
        <script type="text/babel" src="scripts/example.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>

## Nesting Components
A lot of the power of ReactJS is its ability to allow nesting of components. Take the following two components:

<!-- language: lang-js -->
    var React = require('react');
    var createReactClass = require('create-react-class');

    var CommentList = reactCreateClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <div className="commentList">
            Hello, world! I am a CommentList.
          </div>
        );
      }
    });

    var CommentForm = reactCreateClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <div className="commentForm">
            Hello, world! I am a CommentForm.
          </div>
        );
      }
    });

You can nest and refer to those components in the definition of a different component:

<!-- language: lang-js -->
    var React = require('react');
    var createReactClass = require('create-react-class');

    var CommentBox = reactCreateClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <div className="commentBox">
            <h1>Comments</h1>
            <CommentList /> // Which was defined above and can be reused
            <CommentForm /> // Same here
          </div>
        );
      }
    });
Further nesting can be done in three ways, which all have their own places to be used.

# 1. Nesting without using children
_(continued from above)_
<!-- language: lang-js -->
    var CommentList = reactCreateClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <div className="commentList">
            <ListTitle/>
            Hello, world! I am a CommentList.
          </div>
        );
      }
    });
This is the style where A composes B and B composes C.
## Pros
* Easy and fast to separate UI elements
* Easy to inject props down to children based on the parent component's state
## Cons
* Less visibility into the composition architecture
* Less reusability
## Good if
* B and C are just presentational components
* B should be responsible for C's lifecycle

# 2. Nesting using children
_(continued from above)_
<!-- language: lang-js -->
    var CommentBox = reactCreateClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <div className="commentBox">
            <h1>Comments</h1>
            <CommentList>
                <ListTitle/> // child
            </CommentList>
            <CommentForm />
          </div>
        );
      }
    });
This is the style where A composes B and A tells B to compose C. More power to parent components.
## Pros
* Better components lifecycle management
* Better visibility into the composition architecture
* Better reusuability
## Cons
* Injecting props can become a little expensive
* Less flexibility and power in child components
## Good if
* B should accept to compose something different than C in the future or somewhere else
* A should control the lifecycle of C

B would render C using `this.props.children`, and there isn't a structured way for B to know what those children are for. So, B may enrich the child components by giving additional props down, but if B needs to know exactly what they are, #3 might be a better option.

# 3. Nesting using props
_(continued from above)_
<!-- language: lang-js -->
    var CommentBox = reactCreateClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <div className="commentBox">
            <h1>Comments</h1>
            <CommentList title={ListTitle}/> //prop
            <CommentForm />
          </div>
        );
      }
    });
This is the style where A composes B and B provides an option for A to pass something to compose for a specific purpose. More structured composition.
## Pros
* Composition as a feature
* Easy validation
* Better composaiblility
## Cons
* Injecting props can become a little expensive
* Less flexibility and power in child components
## Good if
* B has specific features defined to compose something
* B should only know how to render not what to render

#3 is usually a must for making a public library of components but also a good practice in general to make composable components and clearly define the composition features. #1 is the easiest and fastest to make something that works, but #2 and #3 should provide certain benefits in various use cases.


## Props
Props are a way to pass information into a React component, they can have any type including functions - sometimes referred to as callbacks.

In JSX props are passed with the attribute syntax
<!-- language: lang-js -->
    <MyComponent userID={123} />
Inside the definition for MyComponent userID will now be accessible from the props object
<!-- language: lang-js -->
    // The render function inside MyComponent
    render() {
        return (
            <span>The user's ID is {this.props.userID}</span>
        )
    }

It's important to define all `props`, their types, and where applicable, their default value:

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    // defined at the bottom of MyComponent
    MyComponent.propTypes = {
        someObject: React.PropTypes.object,
        userID: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired,
        title: React.PropTypes.string
    };
    
    MyComponent.defaultProps = {
        someObject: {},
        title: 'My Default Title'
    }

In this example the prop `someObject` is optional, but the prop `userID` is required. If you fail to provide `userID` to `MyComponent`, at runtime the React engine will show a console warning you that the required prop was not provided. Beware though, this warning is only shown in the development version of the React library, the production version will not log any warnings.

Using `defaultProps` allows you to simplify

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    const { title = 'My Default Title' } = this.props;
    console.log(title);

to

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    console.log(this.props.title);

It's also a safeguard for use of `object` `array` and `functions`. If you do not provide a default prop for an object, the following will throw an error if the prop is not passed: 

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    if (this.props.someObject.someKey)

In example above, `this.props.someObject` is `undefined` and therefore the check of `someKey` will throw an error and the code will break. With the use of `defaultProps` you can safely use the above check.

## Component states - Dynamic user-interface
Suppose we want to have the following behaviour - We have a heading (say h3 element) and on clicking it, we want it to become an input box so that we can modify heading name. React makes this highly simple and intuitive using component states and if else statements. (Code explanation below)

    // I have used ReactBootstrap elements. But the code works with regular html elements also
    var Button = ReactBootstrap.Button;
    var Form = ReactBootstrap.Form;
    var FormGroup = ReactBootstrap.FormGroup;
    var FormControl = ReactBootstrap.FormControl;
    
    var Comment = reactCreateClass({
      getInitialState: function() {
        return {show: false, newTitle: ''};
      },
    
      handleTitleSubmit: function() {
         //code to handle input box submit - for example, issue an ajax request to change name in database
      },
    
      handleTitleChange: function(e) {
        //code to change the name in form input box. newTitle is initialized as empty string. We need to update it with the string currently entered by user in the form
        this.setState({newTitle: e.target.value});
      },
    
      changeComponent: function() {
        // this toggles the show variable which is used  for dynamic UI
        this.setState({show: !this.state.show)};
      },
    
      render: function() {
    
        var clickableTitle;
    
        if(this.state.show) {
            clickableTitle = <Form inline onSubmit={this.handleTitleSubmit}>
                                 <FormGroup controlId="formInlineTitle">
                                     <FormControl type="text" onChange={this.handleTitleChange}>
                                 </FormGroup>
                             </Form>;
        } else {
            clickabletitle = <div>
                                <Button bsStyle="link" onClick={this.changeComponent}>
                                    <h3> Default Text </h3>
                                </Button>
                             </div>;
        }

        return (
            <div className="comment">
                {clickableTitle}
            </div>
        );
      }
    });
    
    ReactDOM.render(
        <Comment />, document.getElementById('content')
    );


The main part of the code is the **clickableTitle** variable. Based on the state variable **show**, it can be either be a Form element or a Button element. React allows nesting of components. 

So we can add a {clickableTitle} element in the render function. It looks for the clickableTitle variable. Based on the value 'this.state.show', it displays the corresponding element.

## setState pitfalls
You should use caution when using `setState` in an asynchronous context. For example, you might try to call `setState` in the callback of a get request:

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    class MyClass extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
    
            this.state = {
                user: {}
            };
        }
    
        componentDidMount() {
            this.fetchUser();
        }
    
        fetchUser() {
            $.get('/api/users/self')
                .then((user) => {
                    this.setState({user: user});
                });
        }

        render() {
            return <h1>{this.state.user}</h1>;
        }
    }

This could call problems - if the callback is called after the `Component` is dismounted, then `this.setState` won't be a function. Whenever this is the case, you should be careful to ensure your usage of `setState` is cancellable.

In this example, you might wish to cancel the XHR request when the component dismounts:

<!-- language: lang-js -->

    class MyClass extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
    
            this.state = {
                user: {},
                xhr: null
            };
        }
    
        componentWillUnmount() {
            let xhr = this.state.xhr;
    
            // Cancel the xhr request, so the callback is never called
            if (xhr && xhr.readyState != 4) {
                xhr.abort();
            }
        }
    
        componentDidMount() {
            this.fetchUser();
        }
    
        fetchUser() {
            let xhr = $.get('/api/users/self')
                .then((user) => {
                    this.setState({user: user});
                });
    
            this.setState({xhr: xhr});
        }
    }

The async method is saved as a state. In the `componentWillUnmount` you perform all your cleanup - including canceling the XHR request. 

You could also do something more complex. In this example, I'm creating a 'stateSetter' function that accepts the this object as an argument and prevents `this.setState` when the function `cancel` has been called:

    function stateSetter(context) {
        var cancelled = false;
        return {
            cancel: function () {
                cancelled = true;
            },
            setState(newState) {
                if (!cancelled) {
                    context.setState(newState);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    class Component extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.setter = stateSetter(this);
            this.state = {
                user: 'loading'
            };
        }
        componentWillUnmount() {
            this.setter.cancel();
        }
        componentDidMount() {
            this.fetchUser();
        }
        fetchUser() {
            $.get('/api/users/self')
                .then((user) => {
                    this.setter.setState({user: user});
                });
        }
        render() {
            return <h1>{this.state.user}</h1>
        }
    }

This works because the `cancelled` variable is visible in the `setState` closure we created.
