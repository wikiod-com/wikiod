Higher Order Components ("HOC" in short) is a react application design pattern that is used to enhance components with reusable code. They enable to add functionality and behaviors to existing component classes.

A HOC is a [pure](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22268851/what-is-a-pure-function) javascript function that accepts a component as it's argument and returns a new component with the extended functionality.

HOCs are pretty often used in third party libraries. Such as the Redux [connect](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.m) function.

## Higher Order Component that checks for authentication
Let's say we have a component that should only be displayed if the user is logged in.

So we create a HOC that checks for the authentication on each render():

**AuthenticatedComponent.js**

    import React from "react";
    
    export function requireAuthentication(Component) {
        return class AuthenticatedComponent extends React.Component {

            /**
             * Check if the user is authenticated, this.props.isAuthenticated
             * has to be set from your application logic (or use react-redux to retrieve it from global state).
             */
            isAuthenticated() {
                return this.props.isAuthenticated;
            }
    
            /**
             * Render
             */
            render() {
                const loginErrorMessage = (
                    <div>
                        Please <a href="/login">login</a> in order to view this part of the application.
                    </div>
                );
    
                return (
                    <div>
                        { this.isAuthenticated === true ? <Component {...this.props} /> : loginErrorMessage }
                    </div>
                );
            }
        };
    }
    
    export default requireAuthentication;

We then just use this Higher Order Component in our components that should be hidden from anonymous users:

**MyPrivateComponent.js**

    import React from "react";
    import {requireAuthentication} from "./AuthenticatedComponent";
    
    export class MyPrivateComponent extends React.Component {
        /**
         * Render
         */
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    My secret search, that is only viewable by authenticated users.
                </div>
            );
        }
    }
    
    // Now wrap MyPrivateComponent with the requireAuthentication function 
    export default requireAuthentication(MyPrivateComponent);


This example is described in more detail [here](https://github.com/aspirantic/AuthenticatedComponent).



## Simple Higher Order Component
Let's say we want to console.log each time the component mounts:

**hocLogger.js**

    export default function hocLogger(Component) {
      return class extends React.Component {
        componentDidMount() {
          console.log('Hey, we are mounted!');
        }
        render() {
          return <Component {...this.props} />;
        }
      }
    }

Use this HOC in your code:

**MyLoggedComponent.js**

    import React from "react";
    import {hocLogger} from "./hocLogger";
    
    export class MyLoggedComponent extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <div>
                    This component get's logged to console on each mount.
                </div>
            );
        }
    }

    // Now wrap MyLoggedComponent with the hocLogger function 
    export default hocLogger(MyLoggedComponent);
