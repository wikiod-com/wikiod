Keys in react are used to identify a list of DOM elements from the same hierarchy internally.

So if you are iterating over an array to show a list of li elements, each of the li elements needs a unique identifier specified by the key property. This usually can be the id of your database item or the index of the array.




Using the array index as a key is generally not recommended when the array is going to change over time. From the React Docs:

> As a last resort, you can pass item's index in the array as a key. This can work well if the items are never reordered, but reorders will be slow.

A good example about this: https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318

## Using the id of an element
Here we are having a list of todo items that is passed to the props of our component.

Each todo item has a text and id property. Imagine that the id property comes from a backend datastore and is a unique numeric value:

    todos = [
      {
        id: 1,
        text: 'value 1'
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        text: 'value 2'
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        text: 'value 3'
      },
      {
        id: 4,
        text: 'value 4'
      },
    ];

We set the key attribute of each iterated list element to `todo-${todo.id}` so that react can identify it internally:

    render() {
      const { todos } = this.props;
      return (
        <ul>
          { todos.map((todo) =>
            <li key={ `todo-${todo.id}` }>
              { todo.text }
            </li>
          }
        </ul>
      );
    }

## Using the array index
If you don't have unique database ids at hand, you could also use the numeric index of your array like this:

    render() {
      const { todos } = this.props;
      return (
        <ul>
          { todos.map((todo, index) =>
            <li key={ `todo-${index}` }>
              { todo.text }
            </li>
          }
        </ul>
      );
    }
