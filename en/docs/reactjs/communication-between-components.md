There are a total of 3 cases of communication between React components:

- Case 1: Parent to Child communication
- Case 2: Child to Parent communication
- Case 3: Not-related components (any component to any component) communication

## Child to Parent Components
Sending data back to the parent, to do this we simply **pass a function as a prop from the parent component to the child component**, and **the child component calls that function**.

In this example, we will change the Parent state by passing a function to the Child component and invoking that function inside the Child component.

    import React from 'react';
    
    class Parent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = { count: 0 };

            this.outputEvent = this.outputEvent.bind(this);
        }
        outputEvent(event) {
            // the event context comes from the Child
            this.setState({ count: this.state.count++ });
        }

        render() {
            const variable = 5;
            return (
                <div>
                    Count: { this.state.count }
                    <Child clickHandler={this.outputEvent} />
                </div>
            );
        }
    }
    
    class Child extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return (
                <button onClick={this.props.clickHandler}>
                    Add One More
                </button>
            );
        }
    }

    export default Parent;

Note that the Parent's `outputEvent` method (that changes the Parent state) is invoked by the Child's button `onClick` event.

## Not-related Components
The only way if your components does not have a parent-child relationship (or are related but too further such as a grand grand grand son) is to have some kind of a signal that one component subscribes to, and the other writes into.

Those are the 2 basic operations of any event system: **subscribe/listen** to an event to be notify, and **send/trigger/publish/dispatch** a event to notify the ones who wants.

There are at least 3 patterns to do that. You can find a [comparison here][1].

Here is a brief summary:

- Pattern 1: **Event Emitter/Target/Dispatcher**: the listeners need to reference the source to subscribe.
  - to subscribe: `otherObject.addEventListener('click', () => { alert('click!'); });`
  - to dispatch: `this.dispatchEvent('click');`

- Pattern 2: **Publish/Subscribe**: you don't need a specific reference to the source that triggers the event, there is a global object accessible everywhere that handles all the events.
  - to subscribe: `globalBroadcaster.subscribe('click', () => { alert('click!'); });`
  - to dispatch: `globalBroadcaster.publish('click');`

- Pattern 3: **Signals**: similar to Event Emitter/Target/Dispatcher but you don't use any random strings here. Each object that could emit events needs to have a specific property with that name. This way, you know exactly what events can an object emit.
  - to subscribe: `otherObject.clicked.add( () => { alert('click'); });`
  - to dispatch: `this.clicked.dispatch();`

## Parent to Child Components
That the easiest case actually, very natural in the React world and the chances are - you are already using it.

You can **pass props down to child components**. In this example `message` is the prop that we pass down to the child component, the name message is chosen arbitrarily, you can name it anything you want.

    import React from 'react';

    class Parent extends React.Component {
        render() {
            const variable = 5;
            return (
                <div>
                    <Child message="message for child" />
                    <Child message={variable} />
                </div>
            );
        }
    }

    class Child extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1>
        }
    }

    export default Parent;

Here, the `<Parent />` component renders two `<Child />` components, passing `message for child` inside the first <Child /> component and `5` inside the second one.

In summary, you have a component (parent) that renders another one (child) and passes to it some props.
