To get syntax highlighting in your editor (e.g. VS Code) you'll need to download typing information for the modules that you use in your project.

Say for example you use React and ReactDOM in your project, and you want to get highlighting and Intellisense for them. You will need to add the types to your project using this command:

    npm install --save @types/react @types/react-dom

Your editor should now automatically pick up on on this typing information and supply you with autocomplete and Intellisense for these modules.

## webpack.config.js
    module.exports = {
        entry: './src/index',
        output: {
            path: __dirname + '/build',
            filename: 'bundle.js'
        },
        module: {
            rules: [{
                test: /\.tsx?$/,
                loader: 'ts-loader',
                exclude: /node_modules/
            }]
        },
        resolve: {
            extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx']
        }
    };

The main components are (in addition to the standard `entry`, `output` and other webpack properties):

# The loader

For this you need to create a rule that tests for the `.ts` and `.tsx` file extensions, specify `ts-loader` as the loader.

# Resolve TS extensions

You also need to add the `.ts` and `.tsx` extensions in the `resolve` array, or webpack won't see them.


## tsconfig.json
This is a minimal tsconfig to get you up and running.

    {
        "include": [
            "src/*"
        ],
        "compilerOptions": {
            "target": "es5",
            "jsx": "react",
            "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
        }
    }

Let's go through the properties one by one:

 ## `include`

This is an array of source code. Here we have only one entry, `src/*`, which specifies that everything in the `src` directory is to be included in compilation.

 ## `compilerOptions.target`

Specifies that we want to compile to ES5 target

## `compilerOptions.jsx`

Setting this to `true` will make TypeScript automatically compile your tsx syntax from `<div />` to `React.createElement("div")`.

## `compilerOptions.allowSyntheticDefaultImports`

Handy property which will allow you to import node modules as if they are ES6 modules, so instead of doing 

    import * as React from 'react'
    const { Component } = React

you can just do

    import React, { Component } from 'react'

without any errors telling you that React has no default export.

## My First Component
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    
    
    interface AppProps {
        name: string;
    }
    interface AppState {
        words: string[];
    }
    
    class App extends Component<AppProps, AppState> {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.state = {
                words: ['foo', 'bar']
            };
        }
    
        render() {
            const { name } = this.props;
            return (<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>);
        }
    }
    
    const root = document.getElementById('root');
    ReactDOM.render(<App name="Foo Bar" />, root);

When using TypeScript with React, once you've downloaded the React DefinitelyTyped type definitions (`npm install --save @types/react`), every component will require you to add type annotations.

You do this like so:

    class App extends Component<AppProps, AppState> { }

where `AppProps` and `AppState` are interfaces (or type aliases) for your components' props and state respectively.
