An Unicode code point, what programmers often think of one character, often corresponds to what the user thinks is one character. Sometimes however a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù is made up of multiple code points, as the examples above show.

This means that operations like slicing a string, or getting a character at a given index may not work as expected. For instance the 4<sup>th</sup> character of the string `"CafeÃÅ"` is `'e'` (without the accent). Similarly, clipping the string to length 4 will remove the accent.

The technical term for such a group of code points is a *grapheme cluster*. See [UAX #29: Unicode Text Segmentation](http://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries)

## Diacritics
A letter with a diacritic may be represented with the letter, and a combining modifier letter. You normally think of `eÃÅ` as one character, but it's really 2 code points:

 - `U+0065` ‚Äî LATIN SMALL LETTER E
 - `U+0301` ‚Äî COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT

Similarly `cÃß` = `c` + `¬∏`, and `aÃä` = `a` + `Àö`

## combined forms

To complicate matters, there is often a code point for the composed form as well:

    "CafeÃÅ" = 'C' + 'a' + 'f' + 'e' + '¬¥'
    "Caf√©" = 'C' + 'a' + 'f' + '√©'

Although these strings look the same, they are not equal, and they don't even have the same length (5 and 4 respectively).

## Emoji and flags
A lot of emoji consist of more than one code point.

 - üáØüáµ: A flag is defined as a pair of "regional symbol indicator letters" (üáØ + üáµ)
 - üôãüèø: Some emoji may be followed by a skin tone modifier: üôã + üèø
 - üòÄÔ∏é or üòÄÔ∏è: Windows 10 allows you to specify if an emoji is colored or black/white by appending a variation selector (`U+FE0E` or `U+FE0F`)
 - üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶: a family. Encoded by joining the emoji for boy, girl, woman and man (üë¶, üëß, üë©, üë®) together with zero-width joiners (`U+200D`). On platforms which support it, this is rendered as an emoji of a family with two kids.


## Zalgo Text
There is this thing called [Zalgo Text](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work) which pushes this to the extreme. Here is the first grapheme cluster of the example. It consists of 15 code points: the Latin letter `H` and 14 combining marks.

Although this doesn't show up in normal text, it shows that a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù really can consist of an arbitrary number of code points
