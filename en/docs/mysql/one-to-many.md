The idea of one to many (1:M) concerns the joining of rows to each other, specifically cases where a single row in one table corresponds to many rows in another.

1:M is one-directional, that is, any time you query a 1:M relationship, you can use the 'one' row to select 'many' rows in another table, but you cannot use a single 'many' row to select more than a single 'one' row.

For most cases, working with a 1:M relationship requires us to understand *Primary Keys* and *Foreign Keys*.

**A Primary key** is a column in a table where any single row of that column represents a single entity, or, selecting a value in a primary key column results in exactly one row. Using the above examples, an EMP_ID represents a single employee. If you query for any single EMP_ID, you will see a single row representing the corresponding employee.

**A Foreign Key** is a column in a table that corresponds to the primary key of another different table. From our example above, the MGR_ID in the EMPLOYEES table is a foreign key. Generally to join two tables, you'll join them based on the primary key of one table and the foreign key in another.


## Example Company Tables
Consider a company where every employee who is a manager, manages 1 or more employees, and every employee has only 1 manager.

This results in two tables:

**EMPLOYEES**

| EMP_ID | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME | MGR_ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E01 | Johnny | Appleseed | M02 |
| E02 | Erin|Macklemore | M01 |
| E03 | Colby | Paperwork | M03 |
| E04 | Ron | Sonswan | M01 |

**MANAGERS**

| MGR_ID  | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M01 | Loud | McQueen |
| M02 | Bossy | Pants |
| M03 | Barrel | Jones |

## Get the Employees Managed by a Single Manager
`SELECT
    e.emp_id
,   e.first_name
,   e.last_name
FROM
    employees e
INNER JOIN
    managers m
ON
    m.mgr_id = e.mgr_id
WHERE
    m.mgr_id = 'M01'
;`

Results in:

| EMP_ID | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME |
| --- | --- | --- |
| E02 | Erin | Macklemore |
| E04 | Ron | Sonswan |

Ultimately, for every manager we query for, we will see 1 or more employees returned.

## Get the Manager for a Single Employee
*Consult the above example tables when looking at this example.*

`SELECT
    m.mgr_id
,   m.first_name
,   m.last_name
FROM
    managers m
INNER JOIN
    employees e
ON
    e.mgr_id = m.mgr_id
WHERE
    e.emp_id = 'E03'
;`

| MGR_ID | FIRST_NAME | LAST_NAME |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M03 | Barrel | Jones |

As this is the inverse of the above example, we know that for every employee we query for, we will only ever see one corresponding manager.
