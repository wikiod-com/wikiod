## Syntax
 - UNION DISTINCT -- dedups after combining the SELECTs
 - UNION ALL -- non dedup (faster)
 - UNION -- the default is DISTINCT
 - SELECT ... UNION SELECT ... -- is OK, but ambiguous on `ORDER BY`
 - ( SELECT ... ) UNION ( SELECT ... ) ORDER BY ... -- resolves the ambiguity

UNION does not use multiple CPUs.

UNION always* involves a temp table to collect the results. *As of 5.7.3 / MariaDB 10.1, some forms of UNION deliver the results without using a tmp table (hence, faster).

## Combining SELECT statements with UNION
You can combine the results of two identically structured queries with the `UNION` keyword.

For example, if you wanted a list of all contact info from two separate tables, `authors` and `editors`, for instance, you could use the `UNION` keyword like so:
 
    select name, email, phone_number 
    from authors
    
    union
    
    select name, email, phone_number
    from editors

Using `union` by itself will strip out duplicates. If you needed to keep duplicates in your query, you could use the `ALL` keyword like so: `UNION ALL`.

## ORDER BY
If you need to sort the results of a UNION, use this pattern:

    ( SELECT ... )
    UNION
    ( SELECT ... )
    ORDER BY

Without the parentheses, the final ORDER BY would belong to the last SELECT.

## Pagination via OFFSET
When adding a LIMIT to a UNION, this is the pattern to use:

    ( SELECT ... ORDER BY x  LIMIT 10 )
    UNION
    ( SELECT ... ORDER BY x  LIMIT 10 )
    ORDER BY x  LIMIT 10

Since you cannot predict which SELECT(s) will the "10" will come from, you need to get 10 from each, then further whittle down the list, repeating both the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.

For the 4th page of 10 items, this pattern is needed: 

    ( SELECT ... ORDER BY x  LIMIT 40 )
    UNION
    ( SELECT ... ORDER BY x  LIMIT 40 )
    ORDER BY x  LIMIT 30, 10

That is, collect 4 page's worth in each `SELECT`, then do the `OFFSET` in the `UNION`.


## Combining data with different columns
    SELECT name, caption as title, year, pages FROM books 
    UNION
    SELECT name, title, year, 0 as pages FROM movies

When combining 2 record sets with different columns then emulate the missing ones with default values.


## UNION ALL  and UNION
SELECT 1,22,44
UNION
SELECT 2,33,55

SELECT 1,22,44
UNION
SELECT 2,33,55
UNION 
SELECT 2,33,55

**The result is the same as above.**

use UNION ALL

when

SELECT 1,22,44
UNION
SELECT 2,33,55
UNION ALL
SELECT 2,33,55

## Combining and merging data on different MySQL tables with the same columns into unique rows and running query
This ***UNION ALL*** combines data from multiple tables and serve as a table name alias to use for your queries:


    SELECT YEAR(date_time_column), MONTH(date_time_column), MIN(DATE(date_time_column)), MAX(DATE(date_time_column)), COUNT(DISTINCT (ip)), COUNT(ip), (COUNT(ip) / COUNT(DISTINCT (ip))) AS Ratio
    FROM (
        (SELECT date_time_column, ip FROM server_log_1 WHERE state = 'action' AND log_id = 150) UNION ALL
        (SELECT date_time_column, ip FROM server_log_2 WHERE state = 'action' AND log_id = 150) UNION ALL
        (SELECT date_time_column, ip FROM server_log_3 WHERE state = 'action' AND log_id = 150) UNION ALL
        (SELECT date_time_column, ip FROM server_log WHERE state = 'action' AND log_id = 150)
    ) AS table_all
    GROUP BY YEAR(date_time_column), MONTH(date_time_column);
