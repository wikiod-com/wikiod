## Working with columns containg NULL values
In MySQL and other SQL dialects, `NULL` values have special properties. 

Consider the following table containing job applicants, the companies they worked for, and the date they left the company. `NULL` indicates that an applicant still works at the company:

    CREATE TABLE example
    (`applicant_id` INT, `company_name` VARCHAR(255), `end_date` DATE);
    
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+
    | applicant_id | company_name    | end_date   |
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+
    |            1 | Google          | NULL       |
    |            1 | Initech         | 2013-01-31 |
    |            2 | Woodworking.com | 2016-08-25 |
    |            2 | NY Times        | 2013-11-10 |
    |            3 | NFL.com         | 2014-04-13 |
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+

Your task is to compose a query that returns all rows after `2016-01-01`, including any employees that are still working at a company (those with `NULL` end dates). This select statement:

    SELECT * FROM example WHERE end_date > '2016-01-01';

fails to include any rows with `NULL` values:

    +--------------+-----------------+------------+
    | applicant_id | company_name    | end_date   |
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+
    |            2 | Woodworking.com | 2016-08-25 |
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+

Per the [MySQL documentation][1], comparisons using the arithmetic operators <, >, =, and <> themselves return `NULL` instead of a boolean `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Thus a row with a `NULL` end_date is neither greater than 2016-01-01 nor less than 2016-01-01.

This can be solved by using the keywords IS NULL:

    SELECT * FROM example WHERE end_date > '2016-01-01' OR end_date IS NULL;
    
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+
    | applicant_id | company_name    | end_date   |
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+
    |            1 | Google          | NULL       |
    |            2 | Woodworking.com | 2016-08-25 |
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+

Working with NULLs becomes more complex when the task involves aggregation functions like `MAX()` and a `GROUP BY` clause. If your task were to select the most recent employed date for each applicant_id, the following query would seem a logical first attempt:


    SELECT applicant_id, MAX(end_date) FROM example GROUP BY applicant_id;

    +--------------+---------------+
    | applicant_id | MAX(end_date) |
    +--------------+---------------+
    |            1 | 2013-01-31    |
    |            2 | 2016-08-25    |
    |            3 | 2014-04-13    |
    +--------------+---------------+

However, knowing that `NULL` indicates an applicant is still employed at a company, the first row of the result is inaccurate. Using `CASE WHEN` provides a workaround for the `NULL` issue:

     SELECT
        applicant_id,
        CASE WHEN MAX(end_date is null) = 1 THEN 'present' ELSE MAX(end_date) END
        max_date
    FROM example
    GROUP BY applicant_id;

    +--------------+------------+
    | applicant_id | max_date   |
    +--------------+------------+
    |            1 | present    |
    |            2 | 2016-08-25 |
    |            3 | 2014-04-13 |
    +--------------+------------+

This result can be joined back to the original `example` table to determine the company at which an applicant last worked:

    SELECT 
      data.applicant_id,
      data.company_name,
      data.max_date
    FROM (
      SELECT 
        *,
        CASE WHEN end_date is null THEN 'present' ELSE end_date END max_date
      FROM example
    ) data
    INNER JOIN (
     SELECT
       applicant_id,
       CASE WHEN MAX(end_date is null) = 1 THEN 'present' ELSE MAX(end_date) END max_date
     FROM
       example
     GROUP BY applicant_id
    ) j
    ON data.applicant_id = j.applicant_id AND data.max_date = j.max_date;

    +--------------+-----------------+------------+
    | applicant_id | company_name    | max_date   |
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+
    |            1 | Google          | present    |
    |            2 | Woodworking.com | 2016-08-25 |
    |            3 | NFL.com         | 2014-04-13 |
    +--------------+-----------------+------------+

These are just a few examples of working with `NULL` values in MySQL.
