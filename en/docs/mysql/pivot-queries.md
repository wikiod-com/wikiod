Pivot query creation in MySQL relies upon the `GROUP_CONCAT()` function. If the result of the expression that creates the columns of the pivot query is expected to be large, the value of the `group_concat_max_len` variable must be increased:

    set session group_concat_max_len = 1024 * 1024; -- This should be enough for most cases

## Creating a pivot query
MySQL does not provide a built-in way to create pivot queries. However, these can be created using prepared statements.

Assume the table `tbl_values`:

| Id     | Name   | Group | Value |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 1      | Pete   | A     | 10    |
| 2      | Pete   | B     | 20    |
| 3      | John   | A     | 10    |

Request: Create a query that shows the sum of `Value` for each `Name`; the `Group` must be column header and `Name` must be the row header.

    -- 1. Create an expression that builds the columns
    set @sql = (
        select group_concat(distinct 
            concat(
                "sum(case when `Group`='", Group, "' then `Value` end) as `", `Group`, "`"
            )
        ) 
        from tbl_values
    );

    -- 2. Complete the SQL instruction
    set @sql = concat("select Name, ", @sql, " from tbl_values group by `Name`");

    -- 3. Create a prepared statement
    prepare stmt from @sql;

    -- 4. Execute the prepared statement
    execute stmt;

Result:

| Name | A   |  B   |
| ---- | --- | ---- |
| John | 10  | NULL |
| Pete | 10  | 20   |

**Important:** Deallocate the prepared statement once it's no longer needed:

    deallocate prepare stmt;
