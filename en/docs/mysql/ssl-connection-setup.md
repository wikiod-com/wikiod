## Setup for Debian-based systems
(This assumes MySQL has been installed and that `sudo` is being used.)

# Generating a CA and SSL keys 

Make sure OpenSSL and libraries are installed:

    apt-get -y install openssl
    apt-get -y install libssl-dev

Next make and enter a directory for the SSL files:

    mkdir /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts
    cd /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts

To generate keys, create a certificate authority (CA) to sign the keys (self-signed):

    openssl genrsa 2048 > ca-key.pem
    openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 3600 -key ca-key.pem -out ca.pem

The values entered at each prompt won't affect the configuration. Next create a key for the server, and sign using the CA from before:

    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3600 -nodes -keyout server-key.pem -out server-req.pem
    openssl rsa -in server-key.pem -out server-key.pem
    
    openssl x509 -req -in server-req.pem -days 3600 -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out server-cert.pem

Then create a key for a client:

    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3600 -nodes -keyout client-key.pem -out client-req.pem
    openssl rsa -in client-key.pem -out client-key.pem
    openssl x509 -req -in client-req.pem -days 3600 -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out client-cert.pem

To make sure everything was set up correctly, verify the keys:

    openssl verify -CAfile ca.pem server-cert.pem client-cert.pem

# Adding the keys to MySQL

Open the [MySQL configuration file][1]. For example:

    vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

Under the `[mysqld]` section, add the following options:

    ssl-ca = /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/ca.pem
    ssl-cert = /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/server-cert.pem
    ssl-key = /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/server-key.pem

Restart MySQL. For example:

    service mysql restart

# Test the SSL connection

Connect in the same way, passing in the extra options `ssl-ca`, `ssl-cert`, and `ssl-key`, using the generated client key. For example, assuming `cd /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts`:

    mysql --ssl-ca=ca.pem --ssl-cert=client-cert.pem --ssl-key=client-key.pem -h 127.0.0.1 -u superman -p

After logging in, verify the connection is indeed secure:

    superman@127.0.0.1 [None]> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%ssl%';
    +---------------+-----------------------------------------+
    | Variable_name | Value                                   |
    +---------------+-----------------------------------------+
    | have_openssl  | YES                                     |
    | have_ssl      | YES                                     |
    | ssl_ca        | /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/ca.pem          |
    | ssl_capath    |                                         |
    | ssl_cert      | /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/server-cert.pem |
    | ssl_cipher    |                                         |
    | ssl_crl       |                                         |
    | ssl_crlpath   |                                         |
    | ssl_key       | /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/server-key.pem  |
    +---------------+-----------------------------------------+

You could also check:

    superman@127.0.0.1 [None]> STATUS;
    ...
    SSL:                    Cipher in use is DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
    ...

# Enforcing SSL

This is via `GRANT`, using `REQUIRE SSL`:

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'superman'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' REQUIRE SSL;
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Now, `superman` *must* connect via SSL.

If you don't want to manage client keys, use the client key from earlier and automatically use that for all clients. Open [MySQL configuration file][1], for example:

    vim /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

Under the `[client]` section, add the following options:

    ssl-ca = /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/ca.pem
    ssl-cert = /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/client-cert.pem
    ssl-key = /home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/client-key.pem

Now `superman` only has to type the following to login via SSL:

    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u superman -p

Connecting from another program, for example in Python, typically only requires an additional parameter to the connect function. A Python example:

    import MySQLdb
    ssl = {'cert': '/home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/client-cert.pem', 'key': '/home/ubuntu/mysqlcerts/client-key.pem'}
    conn = MySQLdb.connect(host='127.0.0.1', user='superman', passwd='imsoawesome', ssl=ssl)

## Setup for CentOS7 / RHEL7
This example assumes two servers: 

 1. dbserver  (where our database lives) 
 1. appclient    (where our applications live)

*FWIW, both servers are SELinux enforcing.*


# First, log on to dbserver

Create a temporary directory for creating the certificates.

    mkdir /root/certs/mysql/ && cd /root/certs/mysql/

Create the server certificates

    openssl genrsa 2048 > ca-key.pem
    openssl req -sha1 -new -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -key ca-key.pem > ca-cert.pem
    openssl req -sha1 -newkey rsa:2048 -days 730 -nodes -keyout server-key.pem > server-req.pem
    openssl rsa -in server-key.pem -out server-key.pem
    openssl x509 -sha1 -req -in server-req.pem -days 730  -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 > server-cert.pem

Move server certificates to /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/

Directory path assumes CentOS or RHEL (adjust as needed for other distros): 

    mkdir /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/

Be sure to set permissions on the folder and files.  mysql needs full ownership and access. 

    chown -R mysql:mysql /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql

Now configure MySQL/MariaDB

    # vi /etc/my.cnf
    # i
    [mysqld]
    bind-address=*
    ssl-ca=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-cert.pem
    ssl-cert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/server-cert.pem
    ssl-key=/etc/pki/tls/certs/server-key.pem
    # :wq 

Then 

    systemctl restart mariadb

Don't forget to open your firewall to allow connections from appclient (using IP 1.2.3.4)

    firewall-cmd --zone=drop --permanent --add-rich-rule 'rule family="ipv4" source address="1.2.3.4" service name="mysql" accept'
    # I force everything to the drop zone.  Season the above command to taste.

Now restart firewalld

    service firewalld restart


Next, log in to dbserver's mysql server: 

    mysql -uroot -p 

Issue the following to create a user for the client.  note REQUIRE SSL in GRANT statement. 

    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO ‘iamsecure’@’appclient’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘dingdingding’ REQUIRE SSL;
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES; 
    # quit mysql

You should still be in /root/certs/mysql from the first step. If not, cd back to it for one of the commands below.

Create the client certificates

    openssl req -sha1 -newkey rsa:2048 -days 730 -nodes -keyout client-key.pem > client-req.pem
    openssl rsa -in client-key.pem -out client-key.pem
    openssl x509 -sha1 -req -in client-req.pem -days 730 -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 > client-cert.pem

**Note**: I used the same common name for both server and client certificates. YMMV.  

*Be sure you're still /root/certs/mysql/ for this next command*

Combine server and client CA certificate into a single file: 

    cat server-cert.pem client-cert.pem > ca.pem

Make sure you see two certificates: 

    cat ca.pem 


# END OF SERVER SIDE WORK FOR NOW.

Open another terminal and 

    ssh appclient

As before, create a permanent home for the client certificates

    mkdir /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/

Now, place the client certificates (created on dbserver) on appclient.
You can either scp them over, or just copy and paste the files one by one.

    scp dbserver
    # copy files from dbserver to appclient
    # exit scp

Again, be sure to set permissions on the folder and files.  mysql needs full ownership and access. 

    chown -R mysql:mysql /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql

You should have three files, each owned by user mysql:  

    /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/ca.pem
    /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/client-cert.pem
    /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/client-key.pem


Now edit appclient's MariaDB/MySQL config in the `[client]` section.

    vi /etc/my.cnf
    # i
    [client]
    ssl-ca=/etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/ca.pem
    ssl-cert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/client-cert.pem
    ssl-key=/etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/client-key.pem
    # :wq 

Restart appclient's mariadb service:

    systemctl restart mariadb

# still on the client here

This should return: ssl TRUE

    mysql --ssl --help

Now, log in to appclient's mysql instance

    mysql -uroot -p

Should see YES to both variables below

    show variables LIKE '%ssl';
        have_openssl    YES
        have_ssl              YES


Initially I saw 

     have_openssl NO

A quick look into mariadb.log revealed: 

> SSL error: Unable to get certificate from
> '/etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/client-cert.pem'

The problem was that root owned client-cert.pem and the containing folder.
The solution was to set ownership of /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql/ to mysql.

    chown -R mysql:mysql /etc/pki/tls/certs/mysql

Restart mariadb if needed from the step immediately above



# NOW WE ARE READY TO TEST THE SECURE CONNECTION

# We're still on appclient here

Attempt to connect to dbserver's mysql instance using the account created above.

    mysql -h dbserver -u iamsecure -p
    # enter password dingdingding (hopefully you changed that to something else)

With a little luck you should be logged in without error.


To confirm you are connected with SSL enabled, issue the following command from the MariaDB/MySQL prompt: 

    \s 

*That's a backslash s, aka status*  

That will show the status of your connection, which should look something like this:

    Connection id:        4
    Current database:    
    Current user:        iamsecure@appclient
    SSL:            Cipher in use is DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
    Current pager:        stdout
    Using outfile:        ''
    Using delimiter:    ;
    Server:            MariaDB
    Server version:        5.X.X-MariaDB MariaDB Server
    Protocol version:    10
    Connection:        dbserver via TCP/IP
    Server characterset:    latin1
    Db     characterset:    latin1
    Client characterset:    utf8
    Conn.  characterset:    utf8
    TCP port:        3306
    Uptime:            42 min 13 sec



If you get permission denied errors on your connection attempt, check your GRANT statement above to make sure there aren't any stray characters or ' marks. 

If you have SSL errors, go back through this guide to make sure the steps are orderly.  


This worked on RHEL7 and will likely work on CentOS7, too.  Cannot confirm whether these exact steps will work elsewhere.


Hope this saves someone else a little time and aggravation.
