## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |
| ------ | ------ |
| RETURNS   | Specifies the data type that can be returned from a function.   |
| RETURN | Actual variable or value following the `RETURN` syntax is what is returned to where the function was called from. |

> A stored routine is either a procedure or a function.
> 
> A procedure is invoked using a CALL statement and can only pass back
> values using output variables.
> 
> A function can be called from inside a statement just like any other
> function and can return a scalar value.



## Stored procedure with IN, OUT, INOUT parameters


    DELIMITER $$
     
    DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS sp_nested_loop$$
    CREATE PROCEDURE sp_nested_loop(IN i INT, IN j INT, OUT x INT, OUT y INT, INOUT z INT)
    BEGIN
        DECLARE a INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
        DECLARE b INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
        DECLARE c INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
        WHILE a < i DO
            WHILE b < j DO
                SET c = c + 1;
                SET b = b + 1;
            END WHILE;    
            SET a = a + 1;
            SET b = 0;        
        END WHILE;
        SET x = a, y = c;
        SET z = x + y + z;
    END $$
    DELIMITER ;

Invokes ([CALL][1]) the stored procedure:

    SET @z = 30;
    call sp_nested_loop(10, 20, @x, @y, @z);
    SELECT @x, @y, @z;

Result:

    +------+------+------+
    |  @x  |  @y  |  @z  |
    +------+------+------+
    |  10  |  200 |  240 |
    +------+------+------+


An `IN` parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might modify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller when the procedure returns. 

An `OUT` parameter passes a value from the procedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the procedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure returns. 

An `INOUT` parameter is initialized by the caller, can be modified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is visible to the caller when the procedure returns.

## Create a Function
The following (trivial) example function simply returns the constant `INT` value `12`.

    DELIMITER ||
    CREATE FUNCTION functionname()
    RETURNS INT
    BEGIN
        RETURN 12;
    END;
    ||
    DELIMITER ;

The first line defines what the delimiter character(`DELIMITER ||`) is to be changed to, this is needed to be set before a function is created otherwise if left it at its default `;` then the first `;` that is found in the function body will be taken as the end of the `CREATE` statement, which is usually not what is desired.

After the `CREATE FUNCTION` has run you should set the delimiter back to its default of `;` as is seen after the function code in the above example (`DELIMITER ;`).

Execution this function is as follows:

    SELECT functionname();
    +----------------+
    | functionname() |
    +----------------+
    |             12 |
    +----------------+

A slightly more complex (but still trivial) example takes a parameter and adds a constant to it:

    DELIMITER $$
    CREATE FUNCTION add_2 ( my_arg INT )
      RETURNS INT
    BEGIN
      RETURN (my_arg + 2);
    END;
    $$
    DELIMITER ;

    SELECT add_2(12);
    +-----------+
    | add_2(12) |
    +-----------+
    |        14 |
    +-----------+

Note the use of a different argument to the `DELIMITER` directive. You can actually use any character sequence that does not appear in the `CREATE` statement body, but the usual practice is to use a doubled non-alphanumeric character such as `\\`, `||` or `$$`.

It is good practice to always change the parameter before and after a function, procedure or trigger creation or update as some GUI's don't require the delimiter to change whereas running queries via the command line always require the delimiter to be set.

## Create Procedure with a Constructed Prepare 
    DROP PROCEDURE if exists displayNext100WithName;
    DELIMITER $$
    CREATE PROCEDURE displayNext100WithName
    (    nStart int,
        tblName varchar(100)
    )
    BEGIN
        DECLARE thesql varchar(500); -- holds the constructed sql string to execute
    
        -- expands the sizing of the output buffer to accomodate the output (Max value is at least 4GB)
        SET session group_concat_max_len = 4096; -- prevents group_concat from barfing with error 1160 or whatever it is
    
        SET @thesql=CONCAT("select group_concat(qid order by qid SEPARATOR '%3B') as nums ","from (    select qid from ");
        SET @thesql=CONCAT(@thesql,tblName," where qid>? order by qid limit 100 )xDerived");
        PREPARE stmt1 FROM @thesql; -- create a statement object from the construct sql string to execute
        SET @p1 = nStart; -- transfers parameter passed into a User Variable compatible with the below EXECUTE
        EXECUTE stmt1 USING @p1;
         
        DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt1; -- deallocate the statement object when finished
    END$$
    DELIMITER ;

Creation of the stored procedure shows wrapping with a DELIMITER necessary in many client tools.

Calling example:

    call displayNext100WithName(1,"questions_mysql");

Sample output with `%3B` (semi-colon) separator:

## Cursors
Cursors enable you to itterate results of query one by line. `DECLARE`
command is used to init cursor and associate it with a specific SQL query:

    DECLARE student CURSOR FOR SELECT name FROM studend;

Let's say we sell products of some types. We want to count how many products of each type are exists.

Our data:

    CREATE TABLE product
    (
      id   INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      type VARCHAR(50)      NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(255)     NOT NULL
    
    );
    CREATE TABLE product_type
    (
      name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
    );
    CREATE TABLE product_type_count
    (
      type  VARCHAR(50)      NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      count INT(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
    );
    
    INSERT INTO product_type (name) VALUES
      ('dress'),
      ('food');
    
    INSERT INTO product (type, name) VALUES
      ('dress', 'T-shirt'),
      ('dress', 'Trousers'),
      ('food', 'Apple'),
      ('food', 'Tomatoes'),
      ('food', 'Meat');

We may achieve the goal using stored procedure with using cursor:

    DELIMITER //
    DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS product_count;
    CREATE PROCEDURE product_count()
      BEGIN
        DECLARE p_type VARCHAR(255);
        DECLARE p_count INT(10) UNSIGNED;
        DECLARE done INT DEFAULT 0;
        DECLARE product CURSOR FOR
          SELECT
            type,
            COUNT(*)
          FROM product
          GROUP BY type;
        DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '02000' SET done = 1;
    
        TRUNCATE product_type;
    
        OPEN product;
        
        REPEAT
          FETCH product
          INTO p_type, p_count;
          IF NOT done
          THEN
            INSERT INTO product_type_count
            SET
              type  = p_type,
              count = p_count;
          END IF;
        UNTIL done
        END REPEAT;
        
        CLOSE product;
      END //
    DELIMITER ;

When you may call procedure with:

    CALL product_count();

Result would be in `product_type_count` table:

    type   | count
    ----------------
    dress  |   2
    food   |   3

While that is a good example of a `CURSOR`, notice how the entire body of the procedure can be replaced by just

    INSERT INTO product_type_count
            (type, count)
        SELECT type, COUNT(*)
            FROM product
            GROUP BY type;

This will run a lot faster.

## Multiple ResultSets
Unlike a `SELECT` statement, a `Stored Procedure` returns multiple result sets.  The requires different code to be used for gathering the results of a `CALL` in Perl, PHP, etc.

(Need specific code here or elsewhere!)

## Create a function
    DELIMITER $$
    CREATE
        DEFINER=`db_username`@`hostname_or_IP`
        FUNCTION `function_name`(optional_param data_type(length_if_applicable))
        RETURNS data_type
    BEGIN
        /*
        SQL Statements goes here
        */
    END$$
    DELIMITER ;
    
The RETURNS data_type is any MySQL datatype.
