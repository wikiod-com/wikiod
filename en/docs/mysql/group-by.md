## Syntax


 1. SELECT expression1, expression2, ... expression_n,
 2. aggregate_function (expression)
 3. FROM tables
 4. [WHERE conditions]
 5. GROUP BY expression1, expression2, ... expression_n;

## Parameters
|Parameter  | DETAILS|
| ------ | ------ |
| expression1, expression2, ... expression_n  | The expressions that are not encapsulated within an aggregate function and must be included in the GROUP BY clause.   |
|aggregate_function|A function such as SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, or AVG functions.|
|tables|he tables that you wish to retrieve records from. There must be at least one table listed in the FROM clause.|
|WHERE conditions|Optional. The conditions that must be met for the records to be selected.|

The MySQL GROUP BY clause is used in a SELECT statement to collect data across multiple records and group the results by one or more columns.

Its behavior is governed in part by the value of [the `ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY` variable][1]. When this is enabled, `SELECT` statements that group by any column not in the output return an error. ([This is the default as of 5.7.5][2].) Both setting and not setting this variable can cause problems for naive users or users accustomed to other DBMSs.

## GROUP BY using HAVING
    SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS "Man_Power"
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10;

Using `GROUP BY ... HAVING` to filter aggregate records is analogous to using `SELECT ... WHERE` to filter individual records.

You could also say `HAVING Man_Power >= 10` since `HAVING` understands "aliases".

## Group By using Group Concat
[Group Concat][1] is used in MySQL to get concatenated values of expressions with more than one result per column. Meaning, there are many rows to be selected back for one column such as `Name(1):Score(*)`

| Name   | Score  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Adam   | A+     |
| Adam   | A-     |
| Adam   | B      |
| Adam   | C+     |
| Bill   | D-     |
| John   | A-     |

    SELECT Name, GROUP_CONCAT(Score ORDER BY Score desc SEPERATOR ' ') AS Grades
    FROM   Grade
    GROUP BY Name

Results:

    +------+------------+ 
    | Name | Grades     | 
    +------+------------+ 
    | Adam | C+ B A- A+ | 
    | Bill | D-         | 
    | John | A-         | 
    +------+------------+

## Group By Using MIN function
Assume a table of employees in which each row is an employee who has a `name`, a `department`, and a `salary`.

    SELECT department, MIN(salary) AS "Lowest salary"
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department;


This would tell you which department contains the employee with the lowest salary, and what that salary is. Finding the `name` of the employee with the lowest salary in each department is a different problem, beyond the scope of this Example. See "groupwise max".

## GROUP BY with AGGREGATE functions
**Table ORDERS**

    +---------+------------+----------+-------+--------+
    | orderid | customerid | customer | total | items  |
    +---------+------------+----------+-------+--------+
    |       1 |          1 | Bob      |  1300 |     10 |
    |       2 |          3 | Fred     |   500 |      2 |
    |       3 |          5 | Tess     |  2500 |      8 |
    |       4 |          1 | Bob      |   300 |      6 |
    |       5 |          2 | Carly    |   800 |      3 |
    |       6 |          2 | Carly    |  1000 |     12 |

    |      10 |          1 | Bob      |   500 |     15 |
    +---------+------------+----------+-------+--------+

 - **COUNT**

Return the **number of rows** that satisfy a specific criteria in `WHERE` clause.

E.g.: Number of orders for each customer.

    SELECT customer, COUNT(*) as orders
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer
    ORDER BY customer

**Result:**

    +----------+--------+
    | customer | orders |
    +----------+--------+
    | Bob      |      3 |

## GROUP BY USING SUM Function
    SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS "Total quantity"
    FROM order_details
    GROUP BY product;

## GROUP BY USING COUNT Function
