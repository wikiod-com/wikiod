You need to be at MySQL version 5.6.4 or later to declare columns with fractional-second time datatypes.

For example, `DATETIME(3)` will give you millisecond resolution in your timestamps, and `TIMESTAMP(6)` will give you microsecond resolution on a *nix-style timestamp.

Read this: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fractional-seconds.html

`NOW(3)` will give you the present time from your MySQL server's operating system with millisecond precision.

(Notice that MySQL internal fractional arithmetic, like * 0.001, is always handled as IEEE754 double precision floating point, so it's unlikely you'll lose precision before the Sun becomes a white dwarf star.)

## Get the current time with millisecond precision
    SELECT NOW(3)

does the trick. 

## Get the current time in a form that looks like a Javascript timestamp.
Javascript timestamps are based on the venerable UNIX `time_t` data type, and show the number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00` UTC.

This expression gets the current time as a Javascript timestamp integer. (It does so correctly regardless of the current time_zone setting.)

     ROUND(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(NOW(3)) * 1000.0, 0)

If you have `TIMESTAMP` values stored in a column, you can retrieve them as integer Javascript timestamps using the UNIX_TIMESTAMP() function.

      SELECT ROUND(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(column) * 1000.0, 0)

If your column contains `DATETIME` columns and you retrieve them as Javascript timestamps, those timestamps will be offset by the time zone offset of the time zone they're stored in.

## Create a  table with columns to store sub-second time.
    CREATE TABLE times (
         dt DATETIME(3), 
         ts TIMESTAMP(3)
     );

makes a table with millisecond-precision date / time fields.

     INSERT INTO times VALUES (NOW(3), NOW(3));

inserts a row containing `NOW()` values with millisecond precision into the table.

     INSERT INTO times VALUES ('2015-01-01 16:34:00.123','2015-01-01 16:34:00.128');

inserts specific millisecond precision values.

**Notice** that you must use `NOW(3)` rather than `NOW()` if you use that function to insert high-precision time values.

## Convert a millisecond-precision date / time value to text.
`%f` is the fractional precision format specifier for [the DATE_FORMAT() function][1].

    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(3), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s.%f')

displays a value like `2016-11-19 09:52:53.248000` with fractional microseconds. Because we used `NOW(3)`, the final three digits in the fraction are 0.

## Store a Javascript timestamp into a TIMESTAMP column
If you have a Javascript timestamp value, for example `1478960868932`, you can convert that to a MySQL fractional time value like this:

    FROM_UNIXTIME(1478960868932 * 0.001)


It's simple to use that kind of expression to store your Javascript timestamp into a MySQL table. Do this:

    INSERT INTO table (col) VALUES (FROM_UNIXTIME(1478960868932 * 0.001))

(Obviously, you'll want to insert other columns.)
