After MySQL 5.7, when we install MySQL sometimes we don't need to create a root account or give a root password. By default when we start the server, the default password is stored in the `mysqld.log` file. We need to login in to the system using that password and we need to change it.









Recovering and resetting the default root password using this method is applicable only for MySQL 5.7+

## What happens when the initial start up of the server
Given that the data directory of the server is empty:

  - The server is initialized.
  - SSL certificate and key files are generated in the data directory.
  - The validate_password plugin is installed and enabled.
  - The superuser account 'root'@'localhost' is created. The password for the superuser is set and stored in the error log file.

## How to change the root password by using the default password
To reveal the default "root" password:

    shell> sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log

Change the root password as soon as possible by logging in with the generated temporary password and set a custom password for the superuser account:

    shell> mysql -uroot -p 

    mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass5!'; 


**Note:** MySQL's validate_password plugin is installed by default. This will require that passwords contain at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one digit, and one special character, and that the total password length is at least 8 characters.


## reset root password when " /var/run/mysqld' for UNIX socket file don't exists"
if I forget the password then I'll get error.

    $ mysql -u root -p    
Enter password: 

ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)

I tried to solve the issue by first knowing the status:

    $ systemctl status mysql.service
mysql.service - MySQL Community Server
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mysql.service; enabled; vendor preset: en
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2017-06-08 14:31:33 IST; 38s ago

Then I used the code `mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &` but I get the error:

> mysqld_safe Directory '/var/run/mysqld' for UNIX socket file don't exists.


    $ systemctl stop  mysql.service
    $ ps -eaf|grep mysql
    $ mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &

> I solved:

    $ mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld
    $ chown mysql:mysql /var/run/mysqld
  Now I use the same code `mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &` and get 

> mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql
  

  If I use `$ mysql -u root` I'll get :

    mysql> use mysql
    mysql> describe user;

 Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed

    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR root@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpwd');
 
or If you have a mysql root account that can connect from everywhere, you should also do:

    UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('newpwd') WHERE User='root';

Alternate Method:

       USE mysql
       UPDATE user SET Password = PASSWORD('newpwd')
       WHERE Host = 'localhost' AND User = 'root';

And if you have a root account that can access from everywhere:

     USE mysql
     UPDATE user SET Password = PASSWORD('newpwd')
     WHERE Host = '%' AND User = 'root';`enter code here

   now need to `quit` from mysql and stop/start

    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start

 now again ` mysql -u root -p' and use the new password to get 

>mysql>
