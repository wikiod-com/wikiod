## Syntax
- SELECT column_1 [, column_2 ]  
FROM table_1  
ORDER BY order_column  
LIMIT row_count [OFFSET row_offset]
- SELECT column_1 [, column_2 ]  
FROM table_1  
ORDER BY order_column  
LIMIT [row_offset,] row_count

"Limit" could mean "Max number of rows in a table". 

"Offset" mean pick from `row` number (not to be confused by primary key value or any field data value) 

## Limit and Offset relationship
Considering the following `users` table:

id  | username
--- | ---
1   | User1
2   | User2
3   | User3
4   | User4
5   | User5

In order to constrain the number of rows in the result set of a [`SELECT` query][1], the `LIMIT` clause can be used together with one or two positive integers as arguments (zero included).

# `LIMIT` clause with one argument

When one argument is used, the result set will only be constrained to the number specified in the following manner:

    SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 2

id  | username
--- | ---
1   | User1
2   | User2

If the argument's value is `0`, the result set will be empty.

Also notice that the `ORDER BY` clause may be important in order to specify the first rows of the result set that will be presented (when ordering by another column).

# `LIMIT`clause with two arguments

When two arguments are used in a `LIMIT` clause:

 - the **first** argument represents the row from which the result set rows will be presented â€“ this number is often mentioned as an **offset**, since it represents the row previous to the initial row of the constrained result set. This allows the argument to receive `0` as value and thus taking into consideration the first row of the non-constrained result set.
 - the **second** argument specifies the maximum number of rows to be returned in the result set (similarly to the one argument's example).

Therefore the query:

    SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 2, 3

Presents the following result set:
 
id  | username
--- | ---
3   | User3
4   | User4
5   | User5

Notice that when the **offset** argument is `0`, the result set will be equivalent to a one argument `LIMIT` clause. This means that the following 2 queries:

    SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 0, 2

    SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 2

Produce the same result set:

id  | username
--- | ---
1   | User1
2   | User2


# `OFFSET` keyword: alternative syntax

An alternative syntax for the `LIMIT` clause with two arguments consists in the usage of the `OFFSET` keyword after the first argument in the following manner:

    SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 2 OFFSET 3

This query would return the following result set:

id  | username
--- | ---
3   | User3
4   | User4

Notice that in this alternative syntax the arguments have their positions switched:

- the **first** argument represents the number of rows to be returned in the result set;
- the **second** argument represents the offset.
