## Backticks usage
There are many examples where backticks are used inside a query but for many it's still unclear when or where to use backticks ``` `` ```.

Backticks are mainly used to prevent an error called "*MySQL reserved word*". When making a table in PHPmyAdmin you are sometimes faced with a warning or alert that you are using a "*MySQL reserved word*". 

For example when you create a table with a column named "`group`" you get a warning. This is because you can make the following query: 

    SELECT student_name, AVG(test_score) FROM student GROUP BY group

To make sure you don't get an error in your query you have to use backticks so your query becomes:

    SELECT student_name, AVG(test_score) FROM student GROUP BY `group`

**Table** 
*** 
Not only column names can be surrounded by backticks, but also table names. For example when you need to `JOIN` multiple tables.

    SELECT `users`.`username`, `groups`.`group` FROM `users`

**Easier to read**
***
As you can see using backticks around table and column names also make the query easier to read.

For example when you are used to write querys all in lower case:

    select student_name, AVG(test_score) from student group by group
    select `student_name`, AVG(`test_score`) from `student` group by `group`

Please see the MySQL Manual page entitled [Keywords and Reserved Words][1]. The ones with an (R) are Reserved Words. The others are merely Keywords. The Reserved require special caution.
