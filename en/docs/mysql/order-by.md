## Contexts
The clauses in a `SELECT` have a specific order:

    SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY ... HAVING ...
        ORDER BY ...  -- goes here
        LIMIT ... OFFSET ...;

    ( SELECT ... ) UNION ( SELECT ... ) ORDER BY ...  -- for ordering the result of the UNION.

    SELECT ... GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT x ORDER BY ... SEPARATOR ...) ...

    ALTER TABLE ... ORDER BY ... -- probably useful only for MyISAM; not for InnoDB



        

## Basic
   ORDER BY x

`x` can be any datatype.

* `NULLs` precede non-NULLs.
* The default is `ASC` (lowest to highest)
* Strings (`VARCHAR`, etc) are ordered according the `COLLATION` of the declaration
* `ENUMs` are ordered by the declaration order of its strings.


## ASCending / DESCending
    ORDER BY x ASC  -- same as default
    ORDER BY x DESC  -- highest to lowest
    ORDER BY lastname, firstname  -- typical name sorting; using two columns
    ORDER BY submit_date DESC  -- latest first
    ORDER BY submit_date DESC, id ASC  -- latest first, but fully specifying order.

* `ASC` = `ASCENDING`, `DESC` = `DESCENDING`
* `NULLs` come first even for `DESC`.
* In the above examples, `INDEX(x)`, `INDEX(lastname, firstname)`, `INDEX(submit_date)`  may significantly improve performance.

But... Mixing `ASC` and `DESC`, as in the last example, cannot use a composite index to benefit.  Nor will `INDEX(submit_date DESC, id ASC)` help -- "`DESC`" is recognized syntactically in the `INDEX` declaration, but ignored.

## Some tricks
    ORDER BY FIND_IN_SET(card_type, "MASTER-CARD,VISA,DISCOVER") -- sort 'MASTER-CARD' first.
    ORDER BY x IS NULL, x  -- order by `x`, but put `NULLs` last.

**Custom ordering**

    SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE id IN (118, 17, 113, 23, 72) 
    ORDER BY FIELD(id, 118, 17, 113, 23, 72);

Returns the result in the specified order of ids.

| id| ...|
| ------ | ------ |
| 118   | ...|
| 17    | ...|
| 113   | ...|
| 23    | ...|
| 72    | ...|


 Useful if the ids are already sorted and you just need to retrieve the rows.
