## Implicit / automatic casting


## VARCHAR(255) -- or not
**Suggested max len**

First, I will mention some common strings that are always hex, or otherwise limited to ASCII.  For these, you should specify `CHARACTER SET ascii` (`latin1` is ok) so that it will not waste space:

    UUID CHAR(36) CHARACTER SET ascii -- or pack into BINARY(16)
    country_code CHAR(2) CHARACTER SET ascii
    ip_address CHAR(39) CHARACTER SET ascii -- or pack into BINARY(16)
    phone VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET ascii -- probably enough to handle extension
    postal_code VARCHAR(20) CHARACTER SET ascii -- (not 'zip_code') (don't know the max

    city VARCHAR(100) -- This Russian town needs 91:
        Poselok Uchebnogo Khozyaystva Srednego Professionalno-Tekhnicheskoye Uchilishche Nomer Odin
    country VARCHAR(50) -- probably enough
    name VARCHAR(64) -- probably adequate; more than some government agencies allow

**Why not simply 255?**
There are two reasons to avoid the common practice of using (255) for everything.

* When a complex `SELECT` needs to create temporary table (for a subquery, `UNION`, `GROUP BY`, etc), the preferred choice is to use the `MEMORY` engine, which puts the data in RAM.  But `VARCHARs` are turned into `CHAR` in the process.  This makes `VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4` take 1020 bytes.  That can lead to needing to spill to disk, which is slower.
* In certain situations, InnoDB will look at the potential size of the columns in a table and decide that it will be too big, aborting a `CREATE TABLE`.

**VARCHAR** versus **TEXT**

Usage hints for `*TEXT`, `CHAR`, and `VARCHAR`, plus some Best Practice:

* Never use `TINYTEXT`.
* Almost never use `CHAR` -- it is fixed length; each character is the max length of the `CHARACTER SET` (eg, 4 bytes/character for utf8mb4).
* With `CHAR`, use `CHARACTER SET ascii` unless you know otherwise.
* `VARCHAR(n)` will truncate at n _characters_; `TEXT` will truncate at some number of _bytes_.  (But, do you want truncation?)
* `*TEXT` _may_ slow down complex `SELECTs` due to how temp tables are handled. 

## INT as AUTO_INCREMENT
Any size of `INT` may be used for `AUTO_INCREMENT`.  `UNSIGNED` is always appropriate.

Keep in mind that certain operations "burn" `AUTO_INCREMENT` ids.  This could lead to an unexpected gap.  Examples:  `INSERT IGNORE` and `REPLACE`.  They _may_ preallocate an id _before_ realizing that it won't be needed. This is expected behavior and by design in the InnoDB engine and should not discourage their use.


## Others
There is already a separate entry for "FLOAT, DOUBLE, and DECIMAL" and "ENUM".  A single page on datatypes is likely to be unwieldy -- I suggest "Field types" (or should it be called "Datatypes"?) be an overview, then split into these topic pages:

 - INTs
 - FLOAT, DOUBLE, and DECIMAL
 - Strings (CHARs, TEXT, etc)
 - BINARY and BLOB
 - DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, and friends
 - ENUM and SET
 - Spatial data
 - [JSON type](https://www.wikiod.com/mysql/json) (MySQL 5.7.8+)
 - How to represent Money, and other common 'types' that need shoehorning into existing datatypes

Where appropriate, each topic page should include, in addition to syntax and examples:

 - Considerations when ALTERing
 - Size (bytes)
 - Contrast with non-MySQL engines (low priority)
 - Considerations when using the datatype in a PRIMARY KEY or secondary key
 - other Best Practice
 - other Performance issues

(I assume this "example" will self-distruct when my suggestions have been satisfied or vetoed.)

## Introduction (numeric)


## Integer Types
Minimal unsigned value is always 0.

| Type | Storage<br>(Bytes) | Minimum Value<br>(Signed) | Maximum Value<br>(Signed) | Maximum Value<br>(Unsigned) |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| `TINYINT` | 1 | -2<sup>7</sup><br>-128 | 2<sup>7</sup>-1<br>127 | 2<sup>8</sup>-1<br>255
| `SMALLINT` | 2 | -2<sup>15</sup><br>-32,768 | 2<sup>15</sup>-1<br>32,767 | 2<sup>16</sup>-1<br>65,535
| `MEDIUMINT` | 3 | -2<sup>23</sup><br>-8,388,608 | 2<sup>23</sup>-1<br>8,388,607 | 2<sup>24</sup>-1<br>16,777,215
| `INT` | 4 |    -2<sup>31</sup><br>-2,147,483,648 | 2<sup>31</sup>-1<br>2,147,483,647 | 2<sup>32</sup>-1<br>4,294,967,295
| `BIGINT` | 8 | -2<sup>63</sup><br>-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 | 2<sup>63</sup>-1<br> 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | 2<sup>64</sup>-1<br>18,446,744,073,709,551,615
 

## Fixed Point Types
MySQL's `DECIMAL` and `NUMERIC` types store exact numeric data values. It is recommended to use these types to preserve exact precision, such as for money.

### Decimal

These values are stored in binary format. In a column declaration, the precision and scale should be specified

Precision represents the number of significant digits that are stored for values.

Scale represents the number of digits stored _after_ the decimal

    salary DECIMAL(5,2)

5 represents the `precision` and 2 represents the `scale`. For this example, the range of values that can be stored in this column is `-999.99 to 999.99`

If the scale parameter is omitted, it defaults to 0

This data type can store up to 65 digits.

The number of bytes taken by `DECIMAL(M,N)` is _approximately_ `M/2`.

## Floating Point Types
`FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` represent _approximate_ data types.

| Type | Storage | Precision | Range |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| FLOAT | 4 bytes   | 23 significant bits / ~7 decimal digits | 10^+/-38
| DOUBLE   | 8 bytes   | 53 significant bits / ~16 decimal digits | 10^+/-308

`REAL` is a synonym for `FLOAT`.  `DOUBLE PRECISION` is a synonym for `DOUBLE`.

Although MySQL also permits (M,D) qualifier, do _not_ use it.  (M,D) means that values can be stored with up to M total digits, where D can be after the decimal.  _Numbers will be rounded twice or truncated; this will cause more trouble than benefit._

Because floating-point values are approximate and not stored as exact values, attempts to treat them as exact in comparisons may lead to problems.  Note in particular that a `FLOAT` value rarely equals a `DOUBLE` value.


## Bit Value Type
The `BIT` type is useful for storing bit-field values. `BIT(M)` allows storage of up to M-bit values where M is in the range of `1 to 64`

You can also specify values with `bit value` notation.

    b'111'      -> 7
    b'10000000' -> 128

Sometimes it is handy to use 'shift' to construct a single-bit value, for example `(1 << 7)` for 128.

The maximum combined size of all BIT columns in an `NDB` table is 4096.

## CHAR(n)
`CHAR(n)` is a string of a _fixed_ length of `n` _characters_.  If it is `CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`, that means it occupies exactly `4*n` _bytes_, regardless of what text is in it.

Most use cases for `CHAR(n)` involve strings that contain English characters, hence should be `CHARACTER SET ascii`.  (`latin1` will do just as good.)

    country_code CHAR(2) CHARACTER SET ascii,
    postal_code  CHAR(6) CHARACTER SET ascii,
    uuid    CHAR(39) CHARACTER SET ascii,  -- more discussion elsewhere

## DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, YEAR, and TIME
The `DATE` datatype comprises the date but no time component. Its format is `'YYYY-MM-DD'` with a range of '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.

The `DATETIME` type includes the time with a format of 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'. It has a range from '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.

The `TIMESTAMP` type is an integer type comprising date and time with an effective range from '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC.

The `YEAR` type represents a year and holds a range from 1901 to 2155.

The `TIME` type represents a time with a format of 'HH:MM:SS' and holds a range from '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'.
