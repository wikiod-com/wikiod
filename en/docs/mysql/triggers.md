## Syntax
 - CREATE
       [DEFINER = { user | CURRENT_USER }]
       TRIGGER trigger_name
       trigger_time trigger_event
       ON tbl_name FOR EACH ROW
       [trigger_order]
       trigger_body
 - trigger_time: { BEFORE | AFTER }
 - trigger_event: { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE }
 - trigger_order: { FOLLOWS | PRECEDES } other_trigger_name

Two points need to draw your attention if you already use triggers on others DB :

# FOR EACH ROW

**`FOR EACH ROW` is a mandatory part of the syntax**

You can't make a *statement* trigger (once by query) like Oracle do. It's more a performance related issue than a real missing feature


# CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER

**The `CREATE OR REPLACE` is not supported by MySQL**

MySQL don't allow this syntax, you have instead to use the following :

    DELIMITER $$
    
    DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS myTrigger;
    $$
    CREATE TRIGGER myTrigger
    -- ...
    
    $$
    DELIMITER ;

Be careful, this is **not an atomic transaction** :
- you'll loose the old trigger if the `CREATE` fail
- on a heavy load, others operations can occurs between the `DROP` and the `CREATE`, use a `LOCK TABLES myTable WRITE;` first to avoid data inconsistency and `UNLOCK TABLES;` after the `CREATE` to release the table

## Basic Trigger
    
**Create Table**

    mysql> CREATE TABLE account (acct_num INT, amount DECIMAL(10,2));
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

**Create Trigger**

    mysql> CREATE TRIGGER ins_sum BEFORE INSERT ON account
        -> FOR EACH ROW SET @sum = @sum + NEW.amount;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

The CREATE TRIGGER statement creates a trigger named ins_sum that is associated with the account table. It also includes clauses that specify the trigger action time, the triggering event, and what to do when the trigger activates

**Insert Value**

To use the trigger, set the accumulator variable (@sum) to zero, execute an INSERT statement, and then see what value the variable has afterward:

    mysql> SET @sum = 0;
    mysql> INSERT INTO account VALUES(137,14.98),(141,1937.50),(97,-100.00);
    mysql> SELECT @sum AS 'Total amount inserted';
    +-----------------------+
    | Total amount inserted |
    +-----------------------+
    | 1852.48               |
    +-----------------------+

In this case, the value of @sum after the INSERT statement has executed is 14.98 + 1937.50 - 100, or 1852.48.

**Drop Trigger**

    mysql> DROP TRIGGER test.ins_sum;

If you drop a table, any triggers for the table are also dropped.


## Types of triggers
# Timing

There are two trigger action time modifiers :
- `BEFORE` trigger activates before executing the request,
- `AFTER` trigger fire after change.

# Triggering event

There are three events that triggers can be attached to: 
- `INSERT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`

# Before Insert trigger example
    DELIMITER $$

    CREATE TRIGGER insert_date 
        BEFORE INSERT ON stack
        FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
            -- set the insert_date field in the request before the insert
        SET NEW.insert_date = NOW();
    END;

    $$
    DELIMITER ;

# Before Update trigger example
    DELIMITER $$

    CREATE TRIGGER update_date 
        BEFORE UPDATE ON stack
        FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
            -- set the update_date field in the request before the update
        SET NEW.update_date = NOW();
    END;

    $$
    DELIMITER ;

# After Delete trigger example
    DELIMITER $$

    CREATE TRIGGER deletion_date 
        AFTER DELETE ON stack
        FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
            -- add a log entry after a successful delete
        INSERT INTO log_action(stack_id, deleted_date) VALUES(OLD.id, NOW());
    END;

    $$
    DELIMITER ;
