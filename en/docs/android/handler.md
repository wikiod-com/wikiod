A Handler can be easily used to execute code after a delayed amount of time. It is also useful for executing code repeatedly after a specified amount of time by calling the Handler.postDelayed() method again from within the Runnable's run() method. 

## HandlerThreads and communication between Threads
As `Handler`s are used to send `Message`s and `Runnable`s to a Thread's message queue it's easy to implement event based communication between multiple Threads. Every Thread that has a `Looper` is able to receive and process messages. A `HandlerThread` is a Thread that implements such a `Looper`, for example the main Thread (UI Thread) implements the features of a `HandlerThread`.

## Creating a Handler for the current Thread

    Handler handler = new Handler();

## Creating a Handler for the main Thread (UI Thread)

    Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());

## Send a Runnable from another Thread to the main Thread

    new Thread(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            // this is executed on another Thread

            // create a Handler associated with the main Thread
            Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());

            // post a Runnable to the main Thread
            handler.post(new Runnable() {
                public void run() {
                    // this is executed on the main Thread
                }
            });
        }
    }).start();

## Creating a Handler for another HandlerThread and sending events to it

    // create another Thread
    HandlerThread otherThread = new HandlerThread("name");

    // create a Handler associated with the other Thread
    Handler handler = new Handler(otherThread.getLooper());

    // post an event to the other Thread
    handler.post(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            // this is executed on the other Thread
        }
    });

## Use Handler to create a Timer (similar to javax.swing.Timer)
This can be useful if you're writing a game or something that needs to execute a piece of code every a few seconds. 

    import android.os.Handler;
    
    public class Timer {
        private Handler handler;
        private boolean paused;
    
        private int interval;
    
        private Runnable task = new Runnable () {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                if (!paused) {
                    runnable.run ();
                    Timer.this.handler.postDelayed (this, interval);
                }
            }
        };
    
        private Runnable runnable;
    
        public int getInterval() {
            return interval;
        }
    
        public void setInterval(int interval) {
            this.interval = interval;
        }
    
        public void startTimer () {
            paused = false;
            handler.postDelayed (task, interval);
        }
    
        public void stopTimer () {
            paused = true;
        }
    
        public Timer (Runnable runnable, int interval, boolean started) {
            handler = new Handler ();
            this.runnable = runnable;
            this.interval = interval;
            if (started)
                startTimer ();
        }
    }

Example usage:

    Timer timer = new Timer(new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }, 1000, true)

This code will print "Hello" every second.

## Using a Handler to execute code after a delayed amount of time
**Executing code after 1.5 seconds:**    

    Handler handler = new Handler();
    handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            //The code you want to run after the time is up
        }
    }, 1500); //the time you want to delay in milliseconds

**Executing code repeatedly every 1 second:**    

    Handler handler = new Handler();
    handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            handler.postDelayed(this, 1000);
        }
    }, 1000); //the time you want to delay in milliseconds

## Stop handler from execution 
To stop the Handler from execution remove the callback attached to it using the runnable running inside it:

    Runnable my_runnable = new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // your code here
        }
    };
    
    public Handler handler = new Handler(); // use 'new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());' if you want this handler to control something in the UI
    // to start the handler
    public void start() {
        handler.postDelayed(my_runnable, 10000);
    }
    
    // to stop the handler
    public void stop() {
        handler.removeCallbacks(my_runnable);
    }
    
    // to reset the handler
    public void restart() {
        handler.removeCallbacks(my_runnable);
        handler.postDelayed(my_runnable, 10000);
    }
