Shared Preferences are **key-value based XML files**. It is located under /data/data/package_name/shared_prefs/<filename.xml>.

So a user with root privileges can navigate to this location and can change its values. If you want to protect values in your shared preferences, you can write a simple encryption and decryption mechanism.

You should know tough, that Shared Preferences were never built to be secure, it's just a simple way to persist data.

## Syntax
 1. public static String encrypt(String input);
 2. public static String decrypt(String input);

## Parameters
| Parameter | Definition|
| ------ | ------ |
| input |     String value to encrypt or decrypt.|

Shared Preferences were never built to be secure, it's just a simple way to persist data.

It is not a good idea to use shared preferences for storing critical information such as user credentials. To save user credentials (such as passwords) you need to use other methods such as Android's `AccountManager`.

## Securing a Shared Preference
**Simple Codec**

Here to illustrate the working principle we can use simple encryption and decryption as follows.

    public static String encrypt(String input) {
        // Simple encryption, not very strong!
        return Base64.encodeToString(input.getBytes(), Base64.DEFAULT);
    }
    
    public static String decrypt(String input) {
        return new String(Base64.decode(input, Base64.DEFAULT));
    }

**Implementation Technique**

    public static String pref_name = "My_Shared_Pref";
    
    // To Write
    SharedPreferences preferences = getSharedPreferences(pref_name, MODE_PRIVATE);
    SharedPreferences.Editor editor = preferences.edit();
    editor.putString(encrypt("password"), encrypt("my_dummy_pass"));
    editor.apply(); // Or commit if targeting old devices
    
    // To Read
    SharedPreferences preferences = getSharedPreferences(pref_name, MODE_PRIVATE);
    String passEncrypted = preferences.getString(encrypt("password"), encrypt("default_value"));
    String password = decrypt(passEncrypted);
