*Otto* is [deprecated][1] in favor of `RxJava` and `RxAndroid`. These projects permit the same event-driven programming model as Otto, but theyâ€™re more capable and offer better control of threading.

## Passing an event
This example describes passing an event using the [Otto Event Bus][1].

To use the Otto Event Bus in **Android Studio** you have to insert the following statement in your modules gradle file:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.squareup:otto:1.3.8'
    }
    

The event we'd like to pass is a simple Java object:

    public class DatabaseContentChangedEvent {
        public String message;

        public DatabaseContentChangedEvent(String message) {
            this.message = message;
        }
    }

We need a Bus to send events. This is typically a singleton:

    import com.squareup.otto.Bus;

    public final class BusProvider {
        private static final Bus mBus = new Bus();

        public static Bus getInstance() {
            return mBus;
        }

        private BusProvider() {
        }
    }

To send an event we only need our BusProvider and it's `post` method. Here we send an event if the action of an AsyncTask is completed:

    public abstract class ContentChangingTask extends AsyncTask<Object, Void, Void> {

        ...

        @Override
        protected void onPostExecute(Void param) {
            BusProvider.getInstance().post(
                new DatabaseContentChangedEvent("Content changed")
            );
        }
    }

## Receiving an event
To receive an event it is necessary to implement a method with the event type as parameter and annotate it using `@Subscribe`. Furthermore you have to register/unregister the instance of your object at the `BusProvider` (see example *Sending an event*):

    public class MyFragment extends Fragment {
        private final static String TAG = "MyFragment";
    
        ...
    
        @Override
        public void onResume() {
            super.onResume();
            BusProvider.getInstance().register(this);
        }
    
        @Override
        public void onPause() {
            super.onPause();
            BusProvider.getInstance().unregister(this);
        }
    
        @Subscribe
        public void onDatabaseContentChanged(DatabaseContentChangedEvent event) {
            Log.i(TAG, "onDatabaseContentChanged: "+event.message);
        }
    }
    
**Important:** In order to receive that event an instance of the class has to exist. This is usually not the case when you want to send a result from one activity to another activity. So check your use case for the event bus.
