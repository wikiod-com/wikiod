## Generate tone of a specific frequency
To play a sound of with a specific tone,we first have to create a sine wave sound.This is done in the following way.

    final int duration = 10; // duration of sound
    final int sampleRate = 22050; // Hz (maximum frequency is 7902.13Hz (B8))
    final int numSamples = duration * sampleRate;
    final double samples[] = new double[numSamples];
    final short buffer[] = new short[numSamples];
    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i) 
    {
     samples[i] = Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * i / (sampleRate / note[0])); // Sine wave
     buffer[i] = (short) (samples[i] * Short.MAX_VALUE);  // Higher amplitude increases volume
    }

Now we have to configure AudioTrack to play in accordance with the generated buffer . It is done in the following manner

    AudioTrack audioTrack = new AudioTrack(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC,
                        sampleRate, AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_MONO,
                        AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT, buffer.length,
                        AudioTrack.MODE_STATIC);
Write the generated buffer and play the track

    audioTrack.write(buffer, 0, buffer.length);
    audioTrack.play();
Hope this helps :)
