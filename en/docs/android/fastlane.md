**fastlane** is a tool for iOS, Mac, and Android developers to automate tedious tasks like generating screenshots, dealing with provisioning profiles, and releasing your application.

## Fastfile lane to build and install all flavors for given build type to a device
Add this lane to your **Fastfile** and run `fastlane installAll type:{BUILD_TYPE}` in command line. Replace `BUILD_TYPE` with the build type you want to build.

For example: `fastlane installAll type:Debug`

This command will build all flavors of given type and install it to your device. Currently, it doesn't work if you have more than one device attached. Make sure you have only one. In the future I'm planning to add option to select target device.

    lane :installAll do |options|

        gradle(task: "clean")

        gradle(task: "assemble",
           build_type: options[:type])

        lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_ALL_APK_OUTPUT_PATHS].each do | apk |

            puts "Uploading APK to Device: " + apk

            begin
                adb(
                    command: "install -r #{apk}"
                )
            rescue => ex
                puts ex
            end
        end
    end

## Fastfile to build and upload multiple flavors to Beta by Crashlytics
This is a sample **Fastfile** setup for a multi-flavor app. It gives you an option to build and deploy all flavors or a single flavor. After the deployment, it reports to **Slack** the status of the deployment, and sends a notification to testers in Beta by Crashlytics testers group.


To build and deploy all flavors use:

    fastlane android beta

To build a single APK and deploy use:

    fastlane android beta app:flavorName


Using a single Fastlane file, you can manage iOS, Android, and Mac apps. If you are using this file just for one app `platform` is not required.

**How It Works**

1) `android` argument tells fastlane that we will use `:android` platform.
2) Inside `:android` platform you can have multiple lanes. Currently, I have only `:beta` lane. The second argument from the command above specifies the lane we want to use.
3) `options[:app]`
4) There are two **Gradle** tasks. First, it runs `gradle clean`. If you provided a flavor with `app` key, fastfile runs `gradle assembleReleaseFlavor`. Otherwise, it runs `gradle assembleRelease` to build all build flavors.
5) If we are building for all flavors, an array of generated APK file names is stored inside `SharedValues::GRADLE_ALL_APK_OUTPUT_PATHS`. We use this to loop through generated files and deploy them to **Beta by Crashlytics**. `notifications` and `groups` fields are optional. They are used to notify testers registered for the app on **Beta by Crashlytics**.
6) If you are familiar with Crashlytics, you might know that to activate an app in the portal, you have to run it on a device and use it first. Otherwise, Crashlytics will assume the app inactive and throw an error. In this scenario, I capture it and report to **Slack** as a failure, so you will know which app is inactive. 
7) If deployment is successful, **fastlane** will send a success message to **Slack**.
8) `#{/([^\/]*)$/.match(apk)}` this regex is used to get flavor name from APK path. You can remove it if it does not work for you.
9) `get_version_name` and `get_version_code` are two **Fastlane** plugins to retrieve app version name and code. You have to install these gems if you want to use, or you can remove them. Read more about Plugins here.
10) The `else` statement will be executed if you are building and deploying a single APK. We don't have to provide `apk_path` to Crashlytics since we have only one app.
11) `error do` block at the end is used to get notified if anything else goes wrong during execution. 


**Note**

Don't forget to replace `SLACK_URL`, `API_TOKEN`, `GROUP_NAME` and `BUILD_SECRET` with your own credentials.
