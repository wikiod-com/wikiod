Note that a `ViewTreeObserver` instance associated with a `View` instance can become invalid while that `View` is still alive. From the `View.getViewTreeObserver` javadocs:

    // The returned ViewTreeObserver observer is not guaranteed to remain
    // valid for the lifetime of this View. If the caller of this method keeps
    // a long-lived reference to ViewTreeObserver, it should always check for
    // the return value of {@link ViewTreeObserver#isAlive()}.

Thus, if you have previously added a listener to a `ViewTreeObserver` instance and now wish to remove it, it is easiest to call `getViewTreeObserver` on the corresponding `View` instance again to receive a fresh `ViewTreeObserver` instance. (Checking `isAlive` on an existing instance is more work for little benefit; if the `ViewTreeObserver` is no longer alive, you'll be fetching that fresh reference anyway!)

## Calculating initial View dimensions in an Activity
    package com.example;

    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.support.annotation.Nullable;
    import android.util.Log;
    import android.view.View;
    import android.view.ViewTreeObserver;

    public class ExampleActivity extends Activity {

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(@Nullable final Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_example);

            final View viewToMeasure = findViewById(R.id.view_to_measure);

            // viewToMeasure dimensions are not known at this point.
            // viewToMeasure.getWidth() and viewToMeasure.getHeight() both return 0,
            // regardless of on-screen size.

            viewToMeasure.getViewTreeObserver().addOnPreDrawListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnPreDrawListener() {
                @Override
                public boolean onPreDraw() {
                    // viewToMeasure is now measured and laid out, and displayed dimensions are known.
                    logComputedViewDimensions(viewToMeasure.getWidth(), viewToMeasure.getHeight());
                    
                    // Remove this listener, as we have now successfully calculated the desired dimensions.
                    viewToMeasure.getViewTreeObserver().removeOnPreDrawListener(this);

                    // Always return true to continue drawing.
                    return true; 
                }
            });
        }

        private void logComputedViewDimensions(final int width, final int height) {
            Log.d("example", "viewToMeasure has width " + width);
            Log.d("example", "viewToMeasure has height " + height);
        }

    }
