The ICMP Ping request can be performed in Android by creating a new process to run the ping request. The outcome of the request can be evaluated upon the completion of the ping request from within its process.

## Performs a single Ping
This example attempts a single Ping request. The ping command inside the `runtime.exec` method call can be modified to any valid ping command you might perform yourself in the command line.

    try {
        Process ipProcess = runtime.exec("/system/bin/ping -c 1 8.8.8.8");
        int exitValue = ipProcess.waitFor();
        ipProcess.destroy();
        
        if(exitValue == 0){
            // Success
        } else { 
            // Failure
        }
    } catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
