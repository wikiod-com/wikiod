## Checking the Android Version on device at runtime
[`Build.VERSION_CODES`][1] is an enumeration of the currently known SDK version codes.  


In order to conditionally run code based on the device's Android version, use the [`TargetApi`][2] annotation to avoid Lint errors, and check the build version before running the code specific to the API level.


Here is an example of how to use a class that was introduced in API-23, in a project that supports API levels lower than 23:

    @Override
    @TargetApi(23)
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT <= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
            //run Marshmallow code
            FingerprintManager fingerprintManager = this.getSystemService(FingerprintManager.class);
            //......................
        }
    }
