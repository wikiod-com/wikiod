Your Apps performance is a crucial element of the user experience. Try to avoid bad performing patterns like doing work on the UI thread and learn how to write fast and responsive apps.

## Save View lookups with the ViewHolder pattern
Especially in a `ListView`, you can run into performance problems by doing too many `findViewById()` calls during scrolling. By using the `ViewHolder` pattern, you can save these lookups and improve your `ListView` performance.

If your list item contains a single `TextView`, create a `ViewHolder` class to store the instance:

    static class ViewHolder {
        TextView myTextView;
    }

While creating your list item, attach a `ViewHolder` object to the list item:

    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
        Item i = getItem(position);
        if(convertView == null) {
            convertView = LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate(R.layout.list_item, parent, false);

            // Create a new ViewHolder and save the TextView instance
            ViewHolder holder = new ViewHolder();
            holder.myTextView = (TextView)convertView.findViewById(R.id.my_text_view);
            convertView.setTag(holder);
        }

        // Retrieve the ViewHolder and use the TextView
        ViewHolder holder = (ViewHolder)convertView.getTag();
        holder.myTextView.setText(i.getText());
       
        return convertView;
    }

Using this pattern, `findViewById()` will only be called when a new `View` is being created and the `ListView` can recycle your views much more efficiently.
