## Syntax

 4. <service android:name=".UploadS3IntentService"android:exported="false" />


An `IntentService` provides a simple way to offload work on a background thread. It handles everything about receiving requests, putting them in a queue, stopping itself, etc. for you. It is also easy to implement, making it the perfect thing to use when you have time-consuming operations to do that don't belong on the Main (UI) thread.

## Creating an IntentService
To create an IntentService, create a class which extends `IntentService`, and within it, a method which overrides `onHandleIntent`:
    
    package com.example.myapp;
    public class MyIntentService extends IntentService {
        @Override
         protected void onHandleIntent (Intent workIntent) {
             //Do something in the background, based on the contents of workIntent.
         }
    }


## Basic IntentService Example
The abstract class [`IntentService`][1] is a base class for services, which run in the background without any user interface. Therefore, in order to update the UI, we have to make use of a receiver, which may be either a [`BroadcastReceiver`][2] or a [`ResultReceiver`][3]:

- A `BroadcastReceiver` should be used if your service needs to communicate with multiple components that want to listen for communication.
- A `ResultReceiver`: should be used if your service needs to communicate with only the parent application (i.e. your application).
    
Within the `IntentService`, we have one key method, `onHandleIntent()`, in which we will do all actions, for example, preparing notifications, creating alarms, etc.

If you want to use you own `IntentService`, you have to extend it as follows:
    
    public class YourIntentService extends IntentService {
        public YourIntentService () {
            super("YourIntentService ");
        }
 
        @Override
        protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
            // TODO: Write your own code here.
        }
    }    

Calling/starting the activity can be done as follows:

    Intent i = new Intent(this, YourIntentService.class);
    startService(i);  // For the service.
    startActivity(i); // For the activity; ignore this for now.

Similar to any activity, you can pass extra information such as bundle data to it as follows:

    Intent passDataIntent = new Intent(this, YourIntentService.class);
    msgIntent.putExtra("foo","bar");
    startService(passDataIntent);

Now assume that we passed some data to the `YourIntentService` class. Based on this data, an action can be performed as follows:

    public class YourIntentService extends IntentService {
        private String actvityValue="bar";
        String retrivedValue=intent.getStringExtra("foo");

        public YourIntentService () {
            super("YourIntentService ");
        }
    
        @Override
        protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
            if(retrivedValue.equals(actvityValue)){
                // Send the notification to foo.
            } else {
                // Retrieving data failed.
            }    
        }
    }

The code above also shows how to handle constraints in the `OnHandleIntent()` method.

## Sample Intent Service
Here is an example of an `IntentService` that pretends to load images in the background. All you need to do to implement an `IntentService` is to provide a constructor that calls the `super(String)` constructor, and you need to implement the `onHandleIntent(Intent)` method. 

    public class ImageLoaderIntentService extends IntentService {

        public static final String IMAGE_URL = "url";

        /**
         * Define a constructor and call the super(String) constructor, in order to name the worker
         * thread - this is important if you want to debug and know the name of the thread upon 
         * which this Service is operating its jobs.
         */
        public ImageLoaderIntentService() {
            super("Example");
        }

        @Override
        protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {
            // This is where you do all your logic - this code is executed on a background thread

            String imageUrl = intent.getStringExtra(IMAGE_URL);

            if (!TextUtils.isEmpty(imageUrl)) {
                Drawable image = HttpUtils.loadImage(imageUrl); // HttpUtils is made-up for the example
            }

            // Send your drawable back to the UI now, so that you can use it - there are many ways
            // to achieve this, but they are out of reach for this example
        }
    }

In order to start an `IntentService`, you need to send an `Intent` to it. You can do so from an `Activity`, for an example. Of course, you're not limited to that. Here is an example of how you would summon your new `Service` from an `Activity` class.

    Intent serviceIntent = new Intent(this, ImageLoaderIntentService.class); // you can use 'this' as the first parameter if your class is a Context (i.e. an Activity, another Service, etc.), otherwise, supply the context differently
    serviceIntent.putExtra(IMAGE_URL, "http://www.example-site.org/some/path/to/an/image");
    startService(serviceIntent); // if you are not using 'this' in the first line, you also have to put the call to the Context object before startService(Intent) here

The `IntentService` processes the data from its `Intent`s sequentially, so that you can send multiple `Intent`s without worrying whether they will collide with each other. Only one `Intent` at a time is processed, the rest go in a queue. When all the jobs are complete, the `IntentService` will shut itself down automatically.
