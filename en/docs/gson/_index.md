Gson is an Open Source Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.

**Goals for Gson**

 - Provide easy to use mechanisms like toString() and constructor
   (factory method) to convert Java to JSON and vice-versa  
 - Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON   
   
 - Allow custom representations for objects  
 - Support arbitrarily complex objects  
 - Generate compact and readable JSON output

Source code of Gson is available on [Github][1].
