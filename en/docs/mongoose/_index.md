> **Mongoose** is a **MongoDB** object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.

> Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.

Mongoose makes it painlessly easy to work with MongoDB database.

We can easily structure our database using `Schemas and Models`, Automate certain things when record is added or updated using `Middlewares/Hooks` and easily get the data we need by `querying` our models.
