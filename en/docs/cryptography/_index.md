Modern cryptography is the cornerstone of computer and communications security. Its foundation is based on concepts of mathematics such as number theory, computational-complexity theory, and probability theory.

Cryptography deals with the securing of digital data. It refers to the design of mechanisms based on mathematical algorithms. The primary objective of using cryptography is to provide the four fundamental information security services; confidentiality, non-repudiation, authentication and data-integrity.
