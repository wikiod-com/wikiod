## Hiding non-interactive content from visible display, still read by screen readers
If you were to hide a link by setting `display: none` in the CSS then screen readers wouldnâ€™t find it.

Instead, we position it absolutely, with clipping.

**CSS**

<code>.offscreen
{
position: absolute;
clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* for Internet Explorer */
clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
padding: 0;
border: 0;
height: 1px;
width: 1px;
overflow: hidden;
}</code>

**HTML**

<code>&lt;div class="offscreen"&gt;This text is hidden.&lt;/div&gt;</code>

Notes by Ted Drake, on use of the off screen technique described:

> Using negative position can create long scroll bars when localizing a
> site for a rtl language. Also, it uses CSS properties that are
> commonly used and easy to accidentally over-ride.
> 
> The Yahoo Accessibility Lab recommends using clip for content that
> should be hidden from the visual user, yet available to screen reader
> users. Thierry Koblentz has a great article on this technique, as well
> as the underlying philosophy behind using the correct CSS techniques
> for hiding content. [Clip your hidden content for better
> accessibility][1]
