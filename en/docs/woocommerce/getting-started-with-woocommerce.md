## Installation or Setup
Woocommerce is a plugin for WordPress and can be installed like any other WordPress plugin. WooCommerce can only be installed on self hosted installations of WordPress, it cannot be installed onto a site hosted by the wordpress.com service.

If you don't have WordPress installed for your website, follow the instructions at https://www.wikiod.com/wordpress/installation-and-configuration or https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress.

**Automatic Installation**

 - Navigate to `yoursite.com/wp-login.php` and login with your administrator username and password. 
 - Navigate to the plugin administration screen at `yoursite.com/wp-admin/plugins.php` and press "Add New" or alternatively press "Add New" under 'Plugins' in the admin vertical main menu.

 - WooCommerce will download from the WordPress plugin repository to your server. When it finishes press "Activate" within the same card.

**Setup**
 - Once activated, WooCommerce should begin it's 'Onboarding Wizard'. You can skip it by pressing "Not right now" but it is handier than an extra hand so let's assume you press "Let's Go".

 - You'll be taken to the "Add New Product" screen which is much like the WordPress post editing screen with some additional product specific options. A series of popups will get you started creating your first product.
