## Drawing with the draw module
Pygame has a module, `pygame.draw`, that contains functions which can draw shapes directly to a Surface.

| Function | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| pygame.draw.rect   | draw a rectangle shape   |
| pygame.draw.polygon   | draw a shape with any number of sides   |
| pygame.draw.circle   | draw a circle around a point   |
| pygame.draw.ellipse   | draw a round shape inside a rectangle   |
| pygame.draw.arc   | draw a partial section of an ellipse   |
| pygame.draw.line   | draw a straight line segment   |
| pygame.draw.lines   | draw multiple contiguous line segments   |
| pygame.draw.aaline   | draw fine antialiased lines   |
| pygame.draw.aalines   | draw a connected sequence of antialiased lines   |
  
## How to use the module ##
To use the module you first need to import and initialize pygame correctly and set a mode for the display. It's convenient to define color constants in advance, making your code more readable and more beautiful. All functions takes a Surface to draw on, a color and a position argument that's either a pygame Rect or a 2-element integer/float sequence (the `pygame.draw.circle` will only take integers because of undefined reasons).

## Example ##
The code below will showcase all the different functions, how they are used and how they look. We'll initialize pygame and define some constants before the examples.
    
    import pygame
    from math import pi
    pygame.init()
    
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((100, 100))
    WHITE = pygame.Color(255, 255, 255)
    RED = pygame.Color(255, 0, 0) 

The black color is the Surface default color and represents the part of the Surface that hasn't been drawn onto. The parameters of each function is explained down below at **Parameters** .
    
## Rect ##
    size = (50, 50)
    
    rect_border = pygame.Surface(size)  # Create a Surface to draw on.
    pygame.draw.rect(rect_border, RED, rect_border.get_rect(), 10)  # Draw on it.
    
    rect_filled = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.rect(rect_filled, RED, rect_filled.get_rect())

## Polygon ##
    size = (50, 50)
    points = [(25, 0), (50, 25), (25, 50), (0, 25)]  # The corner points of the polygon.

    polygon = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.polygon(polygon, RED, points, 10)
    
    polygon_filled = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.polygon(polygon_filled, RED, points)

## Circle ##
    size = (50, 50)
    radius = 25

    circle = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.circle(circle, RED, (radius, radius), radius, 10)  # Position is the center of the circle.

    circle_filled = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.circle(circle_filled, RED, (radius, radius), radius)

The holes is a unfortunate consequence of pygame's drawing algorithm.

## Ellipse ##
    size = (50, 25)  # Minimize it's height so it doesn't look like a circle.

    ellipse = pygame.Surface(size)  
    pygame.draw.ellipse(ellipse, RED, ellipse.get_rect(), 5)

    ellipse_filled = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.ellipse(ellipse_filled, RED, ellipse.get_rect())

The holes is a unfortunate consequence of pygame's drawing algorithm.

## Arc ##
    size = (50, 50)

    arc = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.arc(arc, RED, arc.get_rect(), 0, pi)  # 0 to pi is 180Â° creating a half circle.
    
[![enter image description here][5]][5]

## Line ##
    size = (50, 50)

    line = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.line(line, RED, (0, 0), (50, 50))  # Start at topleft and ends at bottomright.

[![enter image description here][6]][6]
    
## Lines ##
    size = (50, 50)
    points = [(25, 0), (50, 25), (25, 50), (0, 25)]

    lines = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.lines(lines, RED, False, points)

    lines_closed = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.lines(lines_closed, RED, True, points)

[![enter image description here][7]][7]
    
## Antialiased line ##
    size = (50, 50)

    antialiased_line = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.aaline(antialiased_line, RED, (0, 0), (50, 50))
    
[![enter image description here][8]][8]

## Antialiased lines ##
    size = (50, 50)
    points = [(25, 0), (50, 25), (25, 50), (0, 25)]

    antialiased_lines = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.aalines(antialiased_lines, RED, False, points)

    antialiased_lines_closed = pygame.Surface(size)
    pygame.draw.aalines(antialiased_lines_closed, RED, True, points)

## Try it out ##

To try it out for yourself: copy one of the code snippets above and the code below in an empty file, change the name *image* to the name of the Surface you want to blit and experiment.

    import pygame
    from math import pi
    pygame.init()
    
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((100, 100))
    WHITE = pygame.Color(255, 255, 255)
    RED = pygame.Color(255, 0, 0) 

    # But code snippet here
    
    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                quit()
        
        screen.blit(image, (25, 25))
        pygame.display.update()

## Surfaces
In pygame you usually use Surfaces to represent the appearance of objects, and Rectangles to represent their positions. A Surface is like a blank sheet of paper which contain colors or images. There are two ways to create a Surface: blank from scratch or by loading an image.

## Create a Surface ##

To create a Surface you need at minimum it's size, which is a 2-element integer sequence of width and height, representing the size in pixels.

You can also pass additional arguments when creating a Surface to control bit depth, masks and additional features as per-pixel alpha and/or create the image in video memory. This is outside the scope of this example though.

    size = width, height = (32, 32)
    empty_surface = pygame.Surface(size)

You can use the `pygame.draw` module to draw shapes on the Surface, or fill it with a color by calling the Surface method `fill(color)`. The argument *color* is a 3 or 4-element integer sequence or a `pygame.Color` object.

## Load an image ##

More often than not you'd like to use your own images in a game (called sprites). Creating a Surface with your image on is as easy as:

    my_image = pygame.image.load(path_to_image)

The path to the image can be relative or absolute. To improve performance it's usually wise to convert your image to the same pixel format as the screen. This can be done by calling the Surface method `convert()`, like so:

    my_image = pygame.image.load(path_to_image).convert()

If your image contains transparency (alpha values) you just call the method `convert_alpha()` instead:

    my_image = pygame.image.load(path_to_image).convert_alpha()

## Blitting ##

Surfaces needs to be blit to the screen in order to be able to display them. Blitting essentially means copying pixels from one Surface to another (the screen is a Surface as well). You also need to pass the position of the Surface, which should be a 2-element integer sequence or a Rect object. The topleft of the Surface will be placed at the position. 

    screen.blit(my_image, (0, 0))
    pygame.display.update()  # or pygame.display.flip()

It's possible to blit to other Surfaces than the screen. To display what's been blitted to the screen you need to call `pygame.display.update()` or `pygame.display.flip()`.


## Transparency
There are kinds 3 of transparency supported in pygame: colorkeys, Surface alphas, and per-pixel alphas.

Colorkeys
---------

Makes a color fully transparent, or more accurately, making a color simply not be blit. If you have an image with a black rect inside you could set a colorkey to prevent the black color from being blit.

    BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
    my_image.set_colorkey(BLACK)  # Black colors will not be blit.

A Surface can only have one colorkey. Setting another colorkey will overwrite the previous. Colorkeys cannot have different alpha values, it can only make a color not visible.

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

Surface alphas
--------------

Makes the whole Surface transparent by an alpha value. With this method you can have different alpha values but it will affect the whole Surface. 

    my_image.set_alpha(100)  # 0 is fully transparent and 255 fully opaque.

[![enter image description here][2]][2]

Per-pixel alpha
---------------

Makes every pixel in the Surface transparent by a individual alpha value. This gives you the most freedom and flexibility but is also the slowest method. This method also requires the Surface to be created as a per-pixel alpha Surface, and the color arguments needs to contain a fourth alpha integer.

    size = width, height = (32, 32)
    my_image = pygame.Surface(size, pygame.SRCALPHA)  # Creates an empty per-pixel alpha Surface.

The Surface will now draw transparency if the color contains the fourth alpha value.

    BLUE = (0, 0, 255, 255)
    pygame.draw.rect(my_image, BLUE, my_image.get_rect(), 10)

Unlike the other Surfaces, this Surface default color won't be black but transparent. That's why the black rectangle in the middle disappear.

[![enter image description here][3]][3]

Combine colorkey and Surface alpha
----------------------------------

Colorkeys and Surface alphas can be combined, but per-pixel alpha cannot. This can be useful if you don't want the slower performance of a per-pixel Surface.

    purple_image.set_colorkey(BLACK)
    purple_image.set_alpha(50)

Full code
---------

Copy this in an empty file and run it. Press the keys 1, 2, 3 or 4 to make the images appear. Press 2, 3 or 4 multiple times to make them more opaque.

    GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
    BLUE = (0, 0, 255, 50)  # This color contains an extra integer. It's the alpha value.
    PURPLE = (255, 0, 255)
    
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((200, 325))
    screen.fill(WHITE)  # Make the background white. Remember that the screen is a Surface!

    purple_image = pygame.Surface(size)
    
    red_image.set_colorkey(BLACK)
    green_image.set_alpha(50)
    # For the 'blue_image' it's the alpha value of the color that's been drawn to each pixel that determines transparency.
    purple_image.set_colorkey(BLACK)
    purple_image.set_alpha(50)
    
    pygame.draw.rect(red_image, RED, red_image.get_rect(), 10)
