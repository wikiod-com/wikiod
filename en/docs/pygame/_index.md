Pygame is a [Python](https://www.wikiod.com/python) wrapper for [SDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer) – a cross-platform C library for controlling multimedia –, written by Pete Shinners. This means, using pygame, you can write video games or other multimedia applications in Python that will run unaltered on any of SDL’s supported platforms (Windows, Unix, Mac, beOS and others).

This section provides an overview of what pygame is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within pygame, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for pygame is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
