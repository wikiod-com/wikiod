## Add default repository for all projects
Add a init.gradle to your user gradle folder. The init.gradle is recognized on every project.

    Unix: ~/.gradle/init.gradle

> These are also alternative locations where init script can be placed and
> loaded automatically:-
> 
>  - Any ***.gradle** file in **USER_HOME/.gradle/init.d** 
>  - Any ***.gradle** file in    the Gradle installationâ€™s **init.d** directory

init.gradle with mavenLocal as repository in all projects.

    allprojects {
        repositories {
            mavenLocal()
        }
    }

With that you have your local maven cache available in all repositories.
A use case could be to use a jar that you put in ther with "gradle install" in another project without adding the mavenLocal repository to the build.gradle or adding a nexus/artifactory server.
