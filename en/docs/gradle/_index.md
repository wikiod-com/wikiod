[Gradle][1] is an open-source, general-purpose build tool. It is popular in the Java community and is the [preferred build tool for Android][2]. 

### Highlighted Gradle features
 * Declarative build scripts *are* code written in [Groovy][3] or [Kotlin][4]. 
 * Lots of core and [community plugins][5] which use a flexible, convention-based approach
 * [Incremental builds][6] such that tasks whose dependencies who haven't changed aren't rerun. 
 * Built-in dependency resolution for Maven and [Ivy][7]. Contributed plugins provide dependency resolution from other `repositories` such as [npm][8].
 * First-class multi-project builds. 
 * Integration with other build tools like [Maven][9], [Ant][10] and others.
 * [Build Scans][11] that increase developers' the ability to collaborate on and optimize Gradle builds.
