Java StringBuilder class is used to create mutable (modifiable) string. The Java StringBuilder class is same as StringBuffer class except that it is non-synchronized. It is available since JDK 1.5.

## Syntax
 - new StringBuilder ()
 - new StringBuilder (int capacity)
 - new StringBuilder (CharSequence seq) 
 - new StringBuilder (StringBuilder builder)
 - new StringBuilder (String string)

- new StringJoiner (CharSequence delimiter)
- new StringJoiner (CharSequence delimiter, CharSequence prefix, CharSequence suffix)

Creating a new `StringBuilder` with type `char` as a parameter would result in calling the constructor with argument `int capacity` and not the one with argument `String string`:

     StringBuilder v = new StringBuilder('I'); //'I' is a character, "I" is a String.
     System.out.println(v.capacity()); --> output 73
     System.out.println(v.toString()); --> output nothing

## Comparing StringBuffer, StringBuilder, Formatter and StringJoiner
The `StringBuffer`, `StringBuilder`, `Formatter` and `StringJoiner` classes are Java SE utility classes that are primarily used for assembling strings from other information:

  - The `StringBuffer` class has been present since Java 1.0, and provides a variety of methods for building and modifying a "buffer" containing a sequence of characters.

  - The `StringBuilder` class was added in Java 5 to address performance issues with the original `StringBuffer` class.  The APIs for the two clases are essentially the same.  The main difference between `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` is that the former is thread-safe and synchronized and the latter is not.

This example shows how `StringBuilder` is can be used:

    int one = 1;
    String color = "red";
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("One=").append(one).append(", Color=").append(color).append('\n');
    System.out.print(sb);
    // Prints "One=1, Colour=red" followed by an ASCII newline.

(The `StringBuffer` class is used the same way: just change `StringBuilder` to `StringBuffer` in the above)

The `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` classes are suitable for both assembling and modifying strings; i.e they provide methods for replacing and removing characters as well as adding them in various.  The remining two classes are specific to the task of assembling strings.

  - The `Formatter` class was added in Java 5, and is loosely modeled on the `sprintf` function in the C standard library.  It takes a *format* string with embedded *format specifiers* and a sequences of other arguments, and generates a string by converting the arguments into text and substituting them in place of the format specifiers.  The details of the format specifiers say how the arguments are converted into text.

  - The `StringJoiner` class was added in Java 8.  It is a special purpose formatter that succinctly formats a sequence of strings with separators between them.  It is designed with a *fluent* API, and can be used with Java 8 streams.

Here are some typical examples of `Formatter` usage:

    // This does the same thing as the StringBuilder example above
    int one = 1;
    String color = "red";
    Formatter f = new Formatter();
    System.out.print(f.format("One=%d, colour=%s%n", one, color));
    // Prints "One=1, Colour=red" followed by the platform's line separator

    // The same thing using the `String.format` convenience method
    System.out.print(String.format("One=%d, color=%s%n", one, color));

The `StringJoiner` class is not ideal for the above task, so here is an example of a formatting an array of strings.

    StringJoiner sj = new StringJoiner(", ", "[", "]");
    for (String s : new String[]{"A", "B", "C"}) {
        sj.add(s);
    }
    System.out.println(sj);
    // Prints "[A, B, C]"

-------------

The use-cases for the 4 classes can be summarized:

 - `StringBuilder` suitable for any string assembly OR string modification task.
 - `StringBuffer` use (only) when you require a thread-safe version of `StringBuilder`.
 - `Formatter` provides much richer string formatting functionality, but is not as efficient as `StringBuilder`. This is because each call to `Formatter.format(...)` entails:
    - parsing the `format` string,
    - creating and populate a *varargs* array, and
    - autoboxing any primitive type arguments.
 - `StringJoiner` provides succinct and efficient formatting of a sequence of strings with separators, but is not suitable for other formatting tasks.

## Repeat a String n times
Problem: Create a `String` containing `n` repetitions of a `String s`.

The trivial approach would be repeatedly concatenating the `String`

    final int n = ...
    final String s = ...
    String result = "";

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result += s;
    }

This creates `n` new string instances containing 1 to `n` repetitions of `s` resulting in a runtime of `O(s.length() * nÂ²) = O(s.length() * (1+2+...+(n-1)+n))`.

To avoid this `StringBuilder` should be used, which allows creating the `String` in `O(s.length() * n)` instead:

    final int n = ...
    final String s = ...
   
    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        builder.append(s);
    }

    String result = builder.toString();
