Graphics are visual images or designs on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone to inform, illustrate, or entertain. It includes: pictorial representation of data, as in computer-aided design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and in educational and recreational software. Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics.

The Java 2D API is powerful and complex. There are multiple ways to do 2D graphics in Java.

## Example 1: Draw and Fill a Rectangle Using Java
This is an Example which print rectangle and fill color in the rectangle.

Most methods of the Graphics class can be divided into two basic groups:

1. Draw and fill methods, enabling you to render basic shapes, text, and images
2. Attributes setting methods, which affect how that drawing and filling appears

Code Example: Let us start this with a little example of drawing a rectangle and filling color in it.
There we declare two classes, one class is MyPanel and other Class is Test. In class MyPanel we use drawRect( ) & fillRect( ) mathods to draw rectangle and fill Color in it. We set the color by setColor(Color.blue) method.
In Second Class we Test our graphic which is Test Class we make a Frame and put MyPanel with p=new MyPanel() object in it.By running Test Class we see a Rectangle and a Blue Color Filled Rectangle.

First Class: MyPanel

    import javax.swing.*;
    import java.awt.*;
    // MyPanel extends JPanel, which will eventually be placed in a JFrame
    public class MyPanel extends JPanel { 
        // custom painting is performed by the paintComponent method
        @Override
        public void paintComponent(Graphics g){
            // clear the previous painting
            super.paintComponent(g);
            // cast Graphics to Graphics2D
            Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;
            g2.setColor(Color.red); // sets Graphics2D color
            // draw the rectangle
            g2.drawRect(0,0,100,100); // drawRect(x-position, y-position, width, height)
            g2.setColor(Color.blue);
            g2.fillRect(200,0,100,100); // fill new rectangle with color blue
        } 
    }

Second Class: Test

    import javax.swing.;
    import java.awt.;    
    public class Test { //the Class by which we display our rectangle    
        JFrame f;    
        MyPanel p;    
        public Test(){    
            f = new JFrame();    
            // get the content area of Panel.    
            Container c = f.getContentPane();    
            // set the LayoutManager
            c.setLayout(new BorderLayout());        
            p = new MyPanel();    
            // add MyPanel object into container    
            c.add(p); 
            // set the size of the JFrame
            f.setSize(400,400);    
            // make the JFrame visible
            f.setVisible(true);    
            // sets close behavior; EXIT_ON_CLOSE invokes System.exit(0) on closing the JFrame
            f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);    
        }       
        
        public static void main(String args[ ]){    
            Test t = new Test();     
        } 
    }

 **paintComponent( )**  
• It is a main method for painting    
• By default, it first paints the background    
• After that, it performs custom painting (drawing circle, rectangles etc.) 

*Graphic2D refers Graphic2D Class*

**Note:**
The Java 2D API enables you to easily perform the following tasks:

 - Draw lines, rectangles and any other geometric shape.
 - Fill those shapes with solid colors or gradients and textures.
 - Draw text with options for fine control over the font and rendering
   process.
 - Draw images, optionally applying filtering operations.
 - Apply operations such as compositing and transforming during any of
   the above rendering operations.

## Example 2: Drawing and Filling Oval
    import javax.swing.*;    
    import java.awt.*;    

    public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
        @Override
        public void paintComponent(Graphics g){    
            // clear the previous painting
            super.paintComponent(g);    
            Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D)g;    
            g2.setColor(Color.blue);    
            g2.drawOval(0, 0, 20,20);  
            g2.fillOval(50,50,20,20);    
        }
    }
    
**g2.drawOval(int x,int y,int height, int width);**  
This method will draw an oval at specified x and y position with given height and width.   

**g2.fillOval(int x,int y,int height, int width);**
This method will fill an oval at specified x and y position with given height and width.
