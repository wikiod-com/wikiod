## Syntax
 - public type name[ = value];
 - private type name[ = value];
 - protected type name[ = value];
 - type name[ = value];
 - public class name{
 - class name{


**From the [Java tutorial][1]:**

Access level modifiers determine whether other classes can use a particular field or invoke a particular method. There are two levels of access control:

 - At the top level—`public`, or *package-private* (no explicit modifier).
 - At the member level—`public`, `private`, `protected`, or *package-private* (no explicit modifier).

A class may be declared with the modifier `public`, in which case that class is visible to all classes everywhere. If a class has no modifier (the default, also known as *package-private*), it is visible only within its own package.

At the member level, you can also use the `public` modifier or no modifier (*package-private*) just as with top-level classes, and with the same meaning. For members, there are two additional access modifiers: `private` and `protected`. The `private` modifier specifies that the member can only be accessed in its own class. The `protected` modifier specifies that the member can only be accessed within its own package (as with *package-private*) and, in addition, by a subclass of its class in another package.

The following table shows the access to members permitted by each modifier.


**Access Levels:**

| Modifier      | Class  | Package | Subclass | World  |
| ------        | ------ | ------  | ------   | ------ |
| `public`      | Y      | Y       | Y        | Y      |
| `protected`   | Y      | Y       | Y        | N      |
| *no modifier* | Y      | Y       | N        | N      |
| `private`     | Y      | N       | N        | N      |

## Private Visibility
`private` visibility allows a variable to only be accessed by its class.  They are often used in **conjunction** with `public` getters and setters.

    class SomeClass {
        private int variable;
    
        public int getVariable() {
            return variable;
        }
    
        public void setVariable(int variable) {
            this.variable = variable;
        }
    }
    
    public class SomeOtherClass {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SomeClass sc = new SomeClass();
            
            // These statement won't compile because SomeClass#variable is private:
            sc.variable = 7;
            System.out.println(sc.variable);
    
            // Instead, you should use the public getter and setter:
            sc.setVariable(7);
            System.out.println(sc.getVariable());
        }
    }

## Public Visibility
Visible to the class, package, and subclass.

Let's see an example with the class Test.

    public class Test{
        public int number = 2;

        public Test(){

        }
    }

Now let's try to create an instance of the class.  In this example, **we can** access `number` because it is `public`.

    public class Other{
        
        public static void main(String[] args){
            Test t = new Test();
            System.out.println(t.number);
        }

    }

## Package Visibility
With **no modifier**, the default is package visibility. *From the Java Documentation,* "[package visibility] indicates whether classes in the same package as the class (regardless of their parentage) have access to the member." In this example from [`javax.swing`][1],

    package javax.swing;
    public abstract class JComponent extends Container … {
        …
        static boolean DEBUG_GRAPHICS_LOADED;
        …
    }

 `DebugGraphics` is in the same package, so `DEBUG_GRAPHICS_LOADED` is accessible. 

    package javax.swing;
    public class DebugGraphics extends Graphics {
        …
        static {
            JComponent.DEBUG_GRAPHICS_LOADED = true;
        }
        …
    }

This [article][2] gives some background on the topic.

## Protected Visibility
Protected visibility causes means that this member is visible to its package, along with any of its subclasses.

As an example:
    
    package com.stackexchange.docs;
    public class MyClass{
        protected int variable; //This is the variable that we are trying to access
        public MyClass(){
            variable = 2;
        };
    }
    
<hr>

Now we'll extend this class and try to access one of its `protected` members.

    package some.other.pack;
    import com.stackexchange.docs.MyClass;
    public class SubClass extends MyClass{
        public SubClass(){
            super();
            System.out.println(super.variable);
        }
    }

You would be also able to access a `protected` member without extending it if you are accessing it from the same package. 

Note that this modifier only works on members of a class, not on the class itself.

## Summary of Class Member Access Modifiers
| Access Modifier | Visibility | Inheritance 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Private | Class only | Can't be inherited | 
| *No modifier* / Package | In package | Available if subclass in package|
| Protected | In package | Available in subclass | 
| Public | Everywhere | Available in subclass |

There was once a `private protected` (both keywords at once) modifier that could be applied to methods or variables to make them accessible from a subclass outside the package, but make them private to the classes in that package. However, this was [removed in Java 1.0's release](http://stackoverflow.com/q/41431533/6754053).
