Applets have been part of Java since its official release and have been used to teach Java and programming for a number of years.

Recent years have seen an active push to move away from Applets and other browser plugins, with some browsers blocking them or actively not supporting them.

In 2016, Oracle announced their plans to deprecate the plugin, [Moving to a Plugin-Free Web](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/moving_to_a_plugin_free)

Newer and better APIs are now available

An applet is a Java application that normally runs inside a web browser. The basic idea is to interact with the user without the need to interact with the server and transfer information. This concept was very successful around the year 2000 when internet communication was slow and expensive.<br><br>
An applet offers five methods to control their life cycle.

| method name | description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `init()` | is called once when the applet is loaded |
| `destroy()` | is called once when the applet gets removed from memory |
| `start()` | is called whenever the applet gets visible |
| `stop()` | is called whenever the applet get overlapped by other windows |
| `paint()` | is called when needed or manually triggered by calling `repaint()` |


## Creating a GUI
Applets could easily be used to create a GUI. They act like a `Container` and have an `add()` method that takes any `awt` or `swing` component.

    public class MyGUIApplet extends JApplet{

        private JPanel panel;
        private JButton button;
        private JComboBox<String> cmbBox;
        private JTextField textField;

        @Override
        public void init(){
            panel = new JPanel();        
            button = new JButton("ClickMe!");
            button.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
                @Override
                public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {
                    if(((String)cmbBox.getSelectedItem()).equals("greet")) {
                        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Hello " + textField.getText());
                    } else {
                        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,textField.getText() + " stinks!");
                    }
                }
            });
            cmbBox = new JComboBox<>(new String[]{"greet", "offend"});
            textField = new JTextField("John Doe");
            panel.add(cmbBox);
            panel.add(textField);
            panel.add(button);
            add(panel);
        }
    }
    

## Minimal Applet
A very simple applet draws a rectangle and prints a string something on the screen.

    public class MyApplet extends JApplet{ 

        private String str = "StackOverflow";

        @Override
        public void init() {
            setBackground(Color.gray);
        }
        @Override
        public void destroy() {}
        @Override
        public void start() {}
        @Override
        public void stop() {}
        @Override
        public void paint(Graphics g) {
            g.setColor(Color.yellow);
            g.fillRect(1,1,300,150);
            g.setColor(Color.red);
            g.setFont(new Font("TimesRoman", Font.PLAIN, 48));
            g.drawString(str, 10, 80);
        }
    }

The main class of an applet extends from `javax.swing.JApplet`.<br>
<!-- if version [lte Java SE 1.2] -->
Before Java 1.2 and the introduction of the swing API applets had extended from `java.applet.Applet`.
<!-- end version if -->

Applets don't require a main method. The entry point is controlled by the life cycle. To use them, they need to be embedded in a HTML document. This is also the point where their size is defined.

    <html>
      <head></head>
      <body>
         <applet code="MyApplet.class" width="400" height="200"></applet>
      </body>
    </html>
    

## Open links from within the applet
You can use the method `getAppletContext()` to get an `AppletContext` object that allows you to request the browser to open a link. For this you use the method `showDocument()`. Its second parameter tells the browser to use a new window `_blank` or the one that shows the applet `_self`.

    public class MyLinkApplet extends JApplet{
        @Override
        public void init(){
            JButton button = new JButton("ClickMe!");
            button.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
                @Override
                public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {
                    AppletContext a = getAppletContext();                 
                    try {
                        URL url = new URL("http://stackoverflow.com/");
                        a.showDocument(url,"_blank");
                    } catch (Exception e) { /* omitted for brevity */ }   
                }
            });
            add(button);
        }
    }
 

## Loading images, audio and other resources
Java applets are able to load different resources. But since they are running in the web browser of the client you need to make sure that these resources are accessible. Applets are not able to access client resources as the local file system.<br><br>
If you want to load resources from the same URL the Applet is stored you can use the method `getCodeBase()` to retrieve the base URL. To load resources, applets offer the methods `getImage()` and `getAudioClip()` to load images or audio files.<br><br>

**Load and show an image**
-----
    public class MyImgApplet extends JApplet{

        private Image img;

        @Override
        public void init(){
            try {
                img = getImage(new URL("http://cdn.sstatic.net/stackexchange/img/logos/so/so-logo.png"));
            } catch (MalformedURLException e) { /* omitted for brevity */ }
        }
        @Override
            public void paint(Graphics g) {
                g.drawImage(img, 0, 0, this);
            } 
    }

<br>

**Load and play an audio file**
-----
    public class MyAudioApplet extends JApplet{

        private AudioClip audioClip;

        @Override
        public void init(){
            try {
                audioClip = getAudioClip(new URL("URL/TO/AN/AUDIO/FILE.WAV"));
            } catch (MalformedURLException e) { /* omitted for brevity */ }
        }
        @Override
        public void start() {
            audioClip.play();
        } 
        @Override
        public void stop(){
            audioClip.stop();
        }
    }

<br>

**Load and display a text file**
-----
    public class MyTextApplet extends JApplet{
        @Override
        public void init(){
            JTextArea textArea = new JTextArea();
            JScrollPane sp = new JScrollPane(textArea);
            add(sp);
            // load text
            try {
                URL url = new URL("http://www.textfiles.com/fun/quotes.txt");
                InputStream in = url.openStream();
                BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
                String line = "";
                while((line = bf.readLine()) != null) {
                    textArea.append(line + "\n");
                }
            } catch(Exception e) { /* omitted for brevity */ }
        }
    }
