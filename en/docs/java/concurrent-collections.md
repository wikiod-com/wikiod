A _concurrent collection_ is a [collection][1] which permits access by more than one thread at the same time. Different threads can typically iterate through the contents of the collection and add or remove elements. The collection is responsible for ensuring that the collection doesn't become corrupt.

## Thread-safe Collections
By default, the various Collection types are not thread-safe.

However, it's fairly easy to make a collection thread-safe.

    List<String> threadSafeList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<String>());
    Set<String> threadSafeSet = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<String>());
    Map<String, String> threadSafeMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<String, String>());

When you make a thread-safe collection, you should never access it through the original collection, only through the thread-safe wrapper.

<!-- if version [gte Java SE 5] -->

Starting in Java 5, `java.util.collections` has several new thread-safe collections that don't need the various `Collections.synchronized` methods.

    List<String> threadSafeList = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<String>();
    Set<String> threadSafeSet = new ConcurrentHashSet<String>();
    Map<String, String> threadSafeMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<String, String>();
<!-- end version if -->



## Concurrent Collections
Concurrent collections are a generalization of thread-safe collections, that allow for a broader usage in a concurrent environment.

While thread-safe collections have safe element addition or removal from multiple threads, they do not necessarily have safe iteration in the same context (one may not be able to safely iterate through the collection in one thread, while another one modifies it by adding/removing elements).

This is where concurrent collections are used. 

As iteration is often the base implementation of several bulk methods in collections, like `addAll`, `removeAll`, or also collection copying (through a constructor, or other means), sorting, ... the use case for concurrent collections is actually pretty large.

For example, the Java SE 5 `java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList` is a thread safe and concurrent `Lis`t implementation, its [javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CopyOnWriteArrayList.html) states : 

> The "snapshot" style iterator method uses a reference to the state of the array at the point that the iterator was created. This array never changes during the lifetime of the iterator, so interference is impossible and the iterator is guaranteed not to throw ConcurrentModificationException.

Therefore, the following code is safe :

    public class ThreadSafeAndConcurrent {

    public static final List<Integer> LIST = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread modifier = new Thread(new ModifierRunnable());
        Thread iterator = new Thread(new IteratorRunnable());
        modifier.start();
        iterator.start();
        modifier.join();
        iterator.join();
    }

    public static final class ModifierRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                for (int i = 0; i < 50000; i++) {
                    LIST.add(i);
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

    public static final class IteratorRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                    long total = 0;
                    for(Integer inList : LIST) {
                        total += inList;
                    }
                    System.out.println(total);
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
    }

Another concurrent collection regarding iteration is [`ConcurrentLinkedQueue`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentLinkedQueue.html), which states : 

>  Iterators are weakly consistent, returning elements reflecting the state of the queue at some point at or since the creation of the iterator. They do not throw java.util.ConcurrentModificationException, and may proceed concurrently with other operations. Elements contained in the queue since the creation of the iterator will be returned exactly once.

One should check the javadocs to see if a collection is concurrent, or not. The attributes of the iterator returned by the `iterator()` method  ("fail fast", "weakly consistent", ...) is the most important attribute to look for.

Thread safe but non concurrent examples
==============

In the above code, changing the `LIST` declaration to

    public static final List<Integer> LIST = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());

Could (and statistically will on most modern, multi CPU/core architectures) lead to exceptions.

Synchronized collections from the `Collections` utility methods are thread safe for addition/removal of elements, but not iteration (unless the underlying collection being passed to it already is).

## Insertion into ConcurrentHashMap
    public class InsertIntoConcurrentHashMap
    {

        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, SomeObject> concurrentHashMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

            SomeObject value = new SomeObject();
            Integer key = 1;

            SomeObject previousValue = concurrentHashMap.putIfAbsent(1, value);
            if (previousValue != null)
            {
                //Then some other value was mapped to key = 1. 'value' that was passed to
                //putIfAbsent method is NOT inserted, hence, any other thread which calls
                //concurrentHashMap.get(1) would NOT receive a reference to the 'value'  
                //that your thread attempted to insert. Decide how you wish to handle             
                //this situation.
            }

           else
           {
                //'value' reference is mapped to key = 1.
           }
        }
    }
