## Syntax
-    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Source source);
-    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

## Parameters
| Parameter | Details |  
| --------- | ------- |  
| Source |     Source could be either one of String, File or any kind of InputStream |  


The `Scanner` class was introduced in Java 5.  The `reset()` method was added in Java 6, and a couple of new constructors were added in Java 7 for interoperability with the (then) new `Path` interface.


## General Pattern that does most commonly asked about tasks
The following is how to properly use the `java.util.Scanner` class to interactively read user input from `System.in` correctly( sometimes referred to as `stdin`, especially in C, C++ and other languages as well as in Unix and Linux). It idiomatically demonstrates the most common things that are requested to be done.

               If you wanted to use System.in for something else, then don't close the Scanner.

            sis.close();
            System.exit(0);
        }
    }

## Using custom delimiters
You can use custom delimiters (regular expressions) with Scanner, with `.useDelimiter(",")`, to determine how the input is read. This works similarly to `String.split(...)`. For example, you can use `Scanner` to read from a list of comma separated values in a String:

    Scanner scanner = null;
    try{
        scanner = new Scanner("i,like,unicorns").useDelimiter(",");;
        while(scanner.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(scanner.next());
        }
    }catch(Exception e){
        e.printStackTrace();
    }finally{
        if (scanner != null)
            scanner.close();
    }

This will allow you to read every element in the input individually. Note that you should **not** use this to parse CSV data, instead, use a proper CSV parser library, see [CSV parser for Java](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/101100/csv-api-for-java) for other possibilities.
    


## Reading system input using Scanner


## Reading file input using Scanner
    Scanner scanner = null;
    try {
        scanner = new Scanner(new File("Names.txt"));
        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.err.println("Exception occurred!");
    } finally {
        if (scanner != null)
            scanner.close();
    }

Here a `Scanner` object is created by passing a `File` object containing the name of a text file as input. This text file will be opened by the File object and read in by the scanner object in the following lines. `scanner.hasNext()` will check to see if there is a next line of data in the text file. Combining that with a `while` loop will allow you to iterate through every line of data in the `Names.txt` file. To retrieve the data itself, we can use methods such as `nextLine()`,`nextInt()`,`nextBoolean()`, etc. In the example above, `scanner.nextLine()`is used. `nextLine()` refers to the following line in a text file, and combining it with a `scanner` object allows you to print the contents of the line. To close a scanner object, you would use `.close()`.

Using try with resources (from Java 7 onwards), the above mentioned code can be written elegantly as below.

    try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("Names.txt"))) {
        while (scanner.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(scanner.nextLine());
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        System.err.println("Exception occurred!");
    }

## Read the entire input as a String using Scanner


## Read an int from the command line
    import java.util.Scanner;

    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    int number = s.nextInt();

If you want to read an int from the command line, just use this snippet.
First of all, you have to create a Scanner object, that listens to System.in, which is by default the Command Line, when you start the program from the command line. After that, with the help of the Scanner object, you read the first int that the user passes into the command line and store it in the variable number. Now you can do whatever you want with that stored int.





## Carefully Closing a Scanner
it can happen that you use a scanner with the System.in as parameter for the constructor, then you need to be aware that closing the scanner will close the InputStream too giving as next that every try to read the input on that (Or any other scanner object) will throw an `java.util.NoSuchElementException` or an `java.lang.IllegalStateException`

example:


        Scanner sc1 = new Scanner(System.in);
        Scanner sc2 = new Scanner(System.in);
        int x1 = sc1.nextInt();
        sc1.close();
        // java.util.NoSuchElementException
        int x2 = sc2.nextInt();
        // java.lang.IllegalStateException
        x2 = sc1.nextInt();
