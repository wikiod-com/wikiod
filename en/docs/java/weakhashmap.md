Concepts of weak Hashmap

## Concepts of WeakHashmap
**Key Points:-**

- Implementation of Map.
- stores only weak references to its keys.

**Weak References** :
 The objects that are referenced only by weak references are garbage collected eagerly; the GC wonâ€™t wait until it needs memory in that case.

**Diffrence between Hashmap and WeakHashMap:-**

 If the Java memory manager no longer has a strong reference to the object specified as a key, then the entry in the map will be removed in WeakHashMap.

**Example :-**

    public class WeakHashMapTest {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Map hashMap= new HashMap();
            
            Map weakHashMap = new WeakHashMap();
            
            String keyHashMap = new String("keyHashMap");
            String keyWeakHashMap = new String("keyWeakHashMap");
            
            hashMap.put(keyHashMap, "Ankita");
            weakHashMap.put(keyWeakHashMap, "Atul");
            System.gc();
            System.out.println("Before: hash map value:"+hashMap.get("keyHashMap")+" and weak hash map value:"+weakHashMap.get("keyWeakHashMap"));
            
            keyHashMap = null;
            keyWeakHashMap = null;
            
            System.gc();  
            
            System.out.println("After: hash map value:"+hashMap.get("keyHashMap")+" and weak hash map value:"+weakHashMap.get("keyWeakHashMap"));
        }

***Size differences (HashMap vs WeakHashMap):***

 Calling size()  method on HashMap object will return the same number of key-value pairs. size will decrease only if remove() method is called explicitly on the HashMap object.

Because the garbage collector may discard keys at anytime, a WeakHashMap may behave as though an unknown thread is silently removing entries. So it is possible for the size method to return smaller values over time.So, in **WeakHashMap  size decrease happens automatically**.
