Java comes with a powerful and flexible mechanism for localizing your applications, but it's also easy to misuse and wind up with a program that disregards or mangles the user's locale, and therefore how they expect your program to behave.

Your users will expect to see data localized to the formats they're used to, and attempting to support this manually is a fools errand. Here is just a small example of the different ways users expect to see content you might assume is "always" displayed a certain way:

## Automatically formatted Dates using "locale"


`SimpleDateFormatter` is great in a pinch, but like the name suggests it doesn't scale well. 

If you hard-code `"MM/dd/yyyy"` all over your application your international users won't be happy.

# Let Java do the work for you

Use the `static` methods in [`DateFormat`][1] to retrieve the right formatting for your user. For a desktop application (where you'll rely on the [default locale][2]), simply call:

    String localizedDate = DateFormat.getDateInstance(style).format(date);

Where `style` is one of the formatting constants (`FULL`, `LONG`, `MEDIUM`, `SHORT`, etc.) specified in `DateFormat`.

For a server-side application where the user specifies their locale as part of the request, you should pass it explicitly to `getDateInstance()` instead:

    String localizedDate =
        DateFormat.getDateInstance(style, request.getLocale()).format(date);

## String Comparison
Compare two Strings ignoring case:

    "School".equalsIgnoreCase("school"); // true

Don't use

    text1.toLowerCase().equals(text2.toLowerCase());

Languages have different rules for converting upper and lower case. A 'I' would be converted to 'i' in English. But in Turkish a 'I' becomes a 'ı'. If you have to use ```toLowerCase()``` use the overload which expects a ```Locale```: ```String.toLowerCase(Locale)```.

Comparing two Strings ignoring minor differences:

    Collator collator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.GERMAN);
    collator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
    collator.equals("Gärten", "gaerten"); // returns true

Sort Strings respecting natural language order, ignoring case (use collation key to:

    String[] texts = new String[] {"Birne", "äther", "Apfel"};
    Collator collator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.GERMAN);
    collator.setStrength(Collator.SECONDARY); // ignore case
    Arrays.sort(texts, collator::compare); // will return {"Apfel", "äther", "Birne"}


## Locale
The `java.util.Locale` class is used to represent a "geographical, political or cultural" region to localize a given text, number, date or operation to. A Locale object may thus contain a country, region, language, and also a variant of a language, for instance a dialect spoken in a certain region of a country, or spoken in a different country than the country from which the language originates.

The Locale instance is handed to components that need to localize their actions, whether it is converting the input, output, or just need it for internal operations. The Locale class cannot do any internationalization or localization by itself

# Language

The language must be an ISO 639 2 or 3 character language code, or a registered language subtag of up to 8 characters. In case a language has both a 2 and 3 character language code, use the 2 character code. A full list of language codes can be found in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

Language codes are case insensitive, but the Locale class always use lowercase versions of the language codes

# Creating a Locale

Creating a `java.util.Locale` instance can be done in four different ways:

    Locale constants
    Locale constructors
    Locale.Builder class
    Locale.forLanguageTag factory method 

# Java ResourceBundle

You create a ResourceBundle instance like this:

    Locale locale = new Locale("en", "US");
    ResourceBundle labels = ResourceBundle.getBundle("i18n.properties");
    System.out.println(labels.getString("message"));

Consider I have a property file `i18n.properties`:

    message=This is locale

Output:

    This is locale


# Setting Locale #
If you want to reproduce the state using other languages, you can use **`setDefault()`** method. 
Its usage:

     setDefault(Locale.JAPANESE); //Set Japanese
