* Using HttpUrlConnection on Android requires that you add the Internet permission to your app (in the `AndroidManifest.xml`).

* There are also other Java HTTP clients and libraries, such as Square's [OkHttp](http://github.com/square/okhttp/), which are easier to use, and may offer better performance or more features.


## Get response body from a URL as a String

    String getText(String url) throws IOException {
        HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(url).openConnection();
        //add headers to the connection, or check the status if desired..
        
        // handle error response code it occurs
        int responseCode = conn.getResponseCode();
        InputStream inputStream;
        if (200 <= responseCode && responseCode <= 299) {
            inputStream = connection.getInputStream();
        } else {
            inputStream = connection.getErrorStream();
        }

        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(
            new InputStreamReader(
                inputStream));

        StringBuilder response = new StringBuilder();
        String currentLine;

        while ((currentLine = in.readLine()) != null) 
            response.append(currentLine);

        in.close();

        return response.toString();
    }


This will download text data from the specified URL, and return it as a String.

**How this works:**

* First, we create a `HttpUrlConnection` from our URL, with `new URL(url).openConnection()`. We cast the `UrlConnection` this returns to a `HttpUrlConnection`, so we have access to things like adding headers (such as User Agent), or checking the response code. (This example does not do that, but it's easy to add.)

* Then, create `InputStream` basing on the response code (for error handling)

* Then, create a `BufferedReader` which allows us to read text from `InputStream` we get from the connection.

* Now, we append the text to a `StringBuilder`, line by line.

* Close the `InputStream`, and return the String we now have.

**Notes:**

* This method will throw an `IoException` in case of failure (such as a network error, or no internet connection), and it will also throw an _unchecked_ `MalformedUrlException` if the given URL is not valid.

* It can be used for reading from any URL which returns text, such as webpages (HTML), REST APIs which return JSON or XML, etc.

* See also: [Read URL to String in few lines of Java code](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4328711/read-url-to-string-in-few-lines-of-java-code).

Usage:

Is very simple:

    String text = getText(”http://example.com");
    //Do something with the text from example.com, in this case the HTML.

## POST data
    public static void post(String url, byte [] data, String contentType) throws IOException {
        HttpURLConnection connection = null;
        OutputStream out = null;
        InputStream in = null;

        try {
            connection = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(url).openConnection();
            connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", contentType);
            connection.setDoOutput(true);

            out = connection.getOutputStream();
            out.write(data);
            out.close();

            in = connection.getInputStream();
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
            String line = null;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            in.close();

        } finally {
            if (connection != null) connection.disconnect();
            if (out != null) out.close();
            if (in != null) in.close();
        }
    }
This will POST data to the specified URL, then read the response line-by-line.
## How it works ##

 - As usual we obtain the `HttpURLConnection` from a `URL`.
 - Set the content type using `setRequestProperty`, by default it's `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
 - `setDoOutput(true)` tells the connection that we will send data.
 - Then we obtain the `OutputStream` by calling `getOutputStream()` and write data to it. Don't forget to close it after you are done.
 - At last we read the server response.

## Delete resource
       public static void delete (String urlString, String contentType) throws IOException {
            HttpURLConnection connection = null;
        
            try {
                URL url = new URL(urlString);
                connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
                connection.setDoInput(true);
                connection.setRequestMethod("DELETE");
                connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", contentType);
        
                Map<String, List<String>> map = connection.getHeaderFields();
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                Iterator<Map.Entry<String, String>> iterator = responseHeader.entrySet().iterator();
                while(iterator.hasNext())
                {
                    Map.Entry<String, String> entry = iterator.next();
                    sb.append(entry.getKey());
                    sb.append('=').append('"');
                    sb.append(entry.getValue());
                    sb.append('"');
                    if(iterator.hasNext())
                    {
                        sb.append(',').append(' ');
                    }
                }
                System.out.println(sb.toString());
        
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                if (connection != null) connection.disconnect();
            }
        }

This will DELETE the resource in the specified URL, then print the response header.

# How it works

* we obtain the `HttpURLConnection` from a `URL`.
* Set the content type using `setRequestProperty`, by default it's `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
* `setDoInput(true)` tells the connection that we intend to use the URL connection for input.
* `setRequestMethod("DELETE")` to perform HTTP DELETE

At last we print the server response header.

## Check if resource exists
    /**
     * Checks if a resource exists by sending a HEAD-Request.
     * @param url The url of a resource which has to be checked.
     * @return true if the response code is 200 OK.
     */
    public static final boolean checkIfResourceExists(URL url) throws IOException {
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        conn.setRequestMethod("HEAD");
        int code = conn.getResponseCode();
        conn.disconnect();
        return code == 200;
    }

Explanation:
============
If you are just checking if a resource exists, it better to use a HEAD request than a GET. This avoids the overhead of transferring the resource. 

Note that the method only returns `true` if the response code is `200`.  If you anticipate redirect (i.e. 3XX) responses, then the method may need to be enhanced to honor them.
 
Example:
========
    checkIfResourceExists(new URL("http://images.google.com/")); // true
    checkIfResourceExists(new URL("http://pictures.google.com/")); // false
