The goal here is to not lose content, so the regex must not consume (match) any input. Rather it must match *between* the last character of the previous target input and the first character of the next target input. eg for 8-character substrings, we need to break the input up (ie match) at the places marked below:

    a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
                   ^               ^               ^

Ignore the spaces in the input which were required to show *between* character positions.


## Break a string up into substrings all of a known length
The trick is to use a look-behind with the regex `\G`, which means "end of previous match":

    String[] parts = str.split("(?<=\\G.{8})");

The regex matches 8 characters after the end of the last match. Since in this case the match is zero-width, we could more simply say "8 characters after the last match".

Conveniently, `\G` is initialized to start of input, so it works for the first part of the input too.


## Break a string up into substrings all of variable length
Same as the known length example, but insert the length into regex:

    int length = 5;
    String[] parts = str.split("(?<=\\G.{" + length + "})");
