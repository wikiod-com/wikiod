Nothing is really random and thus the javadoc calls those numbers pseudorandom. Those numbers are created with a [pseudorandom number generator][1].

## Pseudo Random Numbers
Java provides, as part of the `utils` package, a basic pseudo-random number generator, appropriately named `Random`. This object can be used to generate a pseudo-random value as any of the built-in numerical datatypes (`int`, `float`, etc). You can also use it to generate a random Boolean value, or a random array of bytes. An example usage is as follows:

    
    import java.util.Random;  

    ...
      
    Random random = new Random();
    int randInt = random.nextInt();
    long randLong = random.nextLong();
    
    double randDouble = random.nextDouble(); //This returns a value between 0.0 and 1.0
    float randFloat = random.nextFloat(); //Same as nextDouble
    
    byte[] randBytes = new byte[16];
    random.nextBytes(randBytes); //nextBytes takes a user-supplied byte array, and fills it with random bytes. It returns nothing.

NOTE: This class only produces fairly low-quality pseudo-random numbers, and should never be used to generate random numbers for cryptographic operations or other situations where higher-quality randomness is critical (For that, you would want to use the `SecureRandom` class, as noted below). An explanation for the distinction between "secure" and "insecure" randomness is beyond the scope of this example.

## Pseudo Random Numbers in Specific Range
The method `nextInt(int bound)` of `Random` accepts an upper exclusive boundary, i.e. a number that the returned random value must be less than. However, only the `nextInt` method accepts a bound; `nextLong`, `nextDouble` etc. do not.

    Random random = new Random();
    random.nextInt(1000); // 0 - 999

    int number = 10 + random.nextInt(100); // number is in the range of 10 to 109
    
Starting in Java 1.7, you may also use `ThreadLocalRandom` ([source][1]). This class provides a thread-safe PRNG (pseudo-random number generator). Note that the `nextInt` method of this class accepts both an upper and lower bound.

    import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;
    
    // nextInt is normally exclusive of the top value,
    // so add 1 to make it inclusive
    ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(min, max + 1);

---

Note that [the official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) states that `nextInt(int bound)` can do weird things when `bound` is near 2<sup>30</sup>+1 (emphasis added):

> The algorithm is slightly tricky. **It rejects values that would result in an uneven distribution** (due to the fact that 2^31 is not divisible by n). The probability of a value being rejected depends on n. **The worst case is n=2^30+1, for which the probability of a reject is 1/2, and the expected number of iterations before the loop terminates is 2.**

In other words, specifying a bound will (slightly) decrease the performance of the `nextInt` method, and this performance decrease will become more pronounced as the `bound` approaches half the max int value.

## Generating cryptographically secure pseudorandom numbers
`Random` and `ThreadLocalRandom` are good enough for everyday use, but they have a big problem: They are based on a [linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator), an algorithm whose output can be predicted rather easily. Thus, these two classes are **not** suitable for cryptographic uses (such as key generation).

One can use `java.security.SecureRandom` in situations where a PRNG with an output that is very hard to predict is required. Predicting the random numbers created by instances of this class is hard enough to label the class as **cryptographically secure**.

    import java.security.SecureRandom;
    import java.util.Arrays;

    public class Foo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SecureRandom rng = new SecureRandom();
            byte[] randomBytes = new byte[64];
            rng.nextBytes(randomBytes); // Fills randomBytes with random bytes (duh)
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(randomBytes));
        }
    }

Besides being cryptographically secure, `SecureRandom` has a gigantic period of 2<sup>160</sup>, compared to `Random`s period of 2<sup>48</sup>. It has one drawback of being considerably slower than `Random` and other linear PRNGs such as [Mersenne Twister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) and [Xorshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift), however.

Note that SecureRandom implementation is both platform and provider dependent. The default `SecureRandom` (given by `SUN` provider in `sun.security.provider.SecureRandom`):

- on Unix-like systems, seeded with data from `/dev/random` and/or `/dev/urandom`.
- on Windows, seeded with calls to `CryptGenRandom()` in [CryptoAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_CryptoAPI).



## Generating Random Numbers with a Specified Seed
    //Creates a Random instance with a seed of 12345.
    Random random = new Random(12345L);

    //Gets a ThreadLocalRandom instance
    ThreadLocalRandom tlr = ThreadLocalRandom.current();

    //Set the instance's seed.
    tlr.setSeed(12345L);
    
Using the same seed to generate random numbers will return the same numbers every time, so setting a different seed for every `Random` instance is a good idea if you don't want to end up with duplicate numbers.
   
A good method to get a `Long` that is different for every call is [`System.currentTimeMillis()`][1]:
    
    Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
    ThreadLocalRandom.current().setSeed(System.currentTimeMillis());

## Select random numbers without duplicates
    /**
     * returns a array of random numbers with no duplicates
     * @param range the range of possible numbers for ex. if 100 then it can be anywhere from 1-100
     * @param length the length of the array of random numbers
     * @return array of random numbers with no duplicates.
     */
    public static int[] getRandomNumbersWithNoDuplicates(int range, int length){
        if (length<range){
            // this is where all the random numbers
            int[] randomNumbers = new int[length];
            
            // loop through all the random numbers to set them
            for (int q = 0; q < randomNumbers.length; q++){
                
                // get the remaining possible numbers
                int remainingNumbers = range-q;
                
                // get a new random number from the remainingNumbers
                int newRandSpot = (int) (Math.random()*remainingNumbers);
                
                newRandSpot++;
                
                // loop through all the possible numbers
                for (int t = 1; t < range+1; t++){
                    
                    // check to see if this number has already been taken
                    boolean taken = false;
                    for (int number : randomNumbers){
                        if (t==number){
                            taken = true;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    // if it hasnt been taken then remove one from the spots
                    if (!taken){
                        newRandSpot--;
                        
                        // if we have gone though all the spots then set the value
                        if (newRandSpot==0){
                            randomNumbers[q] = t;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            return randomNumbers;
        } else {
            // invalid can't have a length larger then the range of possible numbers
        }
        return null;
    }

The method works by looping though an array that has the size of the requested length and finds the remaining length of possible numbers. It sets a random number of those possible numbers `newRandSpot` and finds that number within the non taken number left. It does this by looping through the range and checking to see if that number has already been taken.

---

For example if the range is 5 and the length is 3 and we have already chosen the number 2. Then we have 4 remaining numbers so we get a random number between 1 and 4 and we loop through the range(5) skipping over any numbers that we have already used(2).

Now let's say the next number chosen between 1 & 4 is 3. On the first loop we get 1 which has not yet been taken so we can remove 1 from 3 making it 2. Now on the second loop we get 2 which has been taken so we do nothing. We follow this pattern until we get to 4 where once we remove 1 it becomes 0 so we set the new randomNumber to 4.

## Generating Random number using apache-common lang3
We can use `org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomUtils` to generate random numbers using a single line.  

    int x = RandomUtils.nextInt(1, 1000);

The method `nextInt(int startInclusive, int endExclusive)` takes a range. 

Apart from int, we can generate random `long`, `double`, `float` and `bytes` using this class. 

`RandomUtils` class contains the following methods- 

    static byte[] nextBytes(int count) //Creates an array of random bytes.
    static double nextDouble() //Returns a random double within 0 - Double.MAX_VALUE
    static double nextDouble(double startInclusive, double endInclusive) //Returns a random double within the specified range.
    static float nextFloat() //Returns a random float within 0 - Float.MAX_VALUE
    static float nextFloat(float startInclusive, float endInclusive) //Returns a random float within the specified range.
    static int nextInt() //Returns a random int within 0 - Integer.MAX_VALUE
    static int nextInt(int startInclusive, int endExclusive) //Returns a random integer within the specified range.
    static long nextLong() //Returns a random long within 0 - Long.MAX_VALUE
    static long nextLong(long startInclusive, long endExclusive) //Returns a random long within the specified range.
