As of Java 8, `Calendar` and its subclasses have been superseded by the [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) package and its subpackages.  They should be preferred, unless a legacy API requires Calendar.


## Creating Calendar objects
`Calendar` objects can be created by using `getInstance()` or by using the constructor `GregorianCalendar`.

It's important to notice that months in `Calendar` are zero based, which means that JANUARY is represented by an `int` value 0. In order to provide a better code, always use `Calendar` constants, such as `Calendar.JANUARY` to avoid misunderstandings.

    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
    Calendar gregorianCalendar = new GregorianCalendar();
    Calendar gregorianCalendarAtSpecificDay = new GregorianCalendar(2016, Calendar.JANUARY, 1);
    Calendar gregorianCalendarAtSpecificDayAndTime = new GregorianCalendar(2016, Calendar.JANUARY, 1, 6, 55, 10);

**Note**: Always use the month constants: The numeric representation is [misleading](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/344380/why-is-january-month-0-in-java-calendar), e.g. `Calendar.JANUARY` has the value `0`  

## Increasing / Decreasing calendar fields
`add()` and `roll()` can be used to increase/decrease `Calendar` fields.

    Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar(2016, Calendar.MARCH, 31); // 31 March 2016

The `add()` method affects all fields, and behaves effectively if one were to add or subtract actual dates from the calendar

    calendar.add(Calendar.MONTH, -6);

The above operation removes six months from the calendar, taking us back to 30 September 2015.


To change a particular field without affecting the other fields, use `roll()`.

    calendar.roll(Calendar.MONTH, -6);

The above operation removes six months from the current *month*, so the month is identified as September.  No other fields have been adjusted; the year has not changed with this operation.

## Finding AM/PM
With Calendar class it is easy to find AM or PM.
    
      Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
      cal.setTime(new Date());
      if (cal.get(Calendar.AM_PM) == Calendar.PM)
          System.out.println("It is PM");

## Subtracting calendars
To get a difference between two `Calendar`s, use `getTimeInMillis()` method:

    Calendar c1 = Calendar.getInstance();
    Calendar c2 = Calendar.getInstance();
    c2.set(Calendar.DATE, c2.get(Calendar.DATE) + 1);
    
    System.out.println(c2.getTimeInMillis() - c1.getTimeInMillis()); //outputs 86400000 (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
