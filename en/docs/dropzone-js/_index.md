[dropzone.js][1] is a lightweight script that allows you to provide users with a simple interface to upload files to your server. Note that dropzone.js requires you to have set up server side processing, as mentioned on their [official website][1]. The files are uploaded via AJAX.

It does not require any external libraries such as jQuery.
dropzone.js has features such as thumbnail previews, progress bars, themining support and the ability to upload large files.
