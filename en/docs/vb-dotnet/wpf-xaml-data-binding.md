This example shows how to create a ViewModel and a View within the MVVM pattern and WPF, and how to bind the two together, so that each is updated whenever the other is changed.

## Binding a String in the ViewModel to a TextBox in the View
**SampleViewModel.vb**

    'Import classes related to WPF for simplicity
    Imports System.Collections.ObjectModel
    Imports System.ComponentModel
    
    Public Class SampleViewModel
        Inherits DependencyObject
        'A class acting as a ViewModel must inherit from DependencyObject
        
        'A simple string property
        Public Property SampleString as String
            Get
                Return CType(GetValue(SampleStringProperty), String)
            End Get
            
            Set(ByVal value as String)
                SetValue(SampleStringProperty, value)
            End Set
        End Property

        'The DependencyProperty that makes databinding actually work
        'for the string above
        Public Shared ReadOnly SampleStringProperty As DependencyProperty = _
                               DependencyProperty.Register("SampleString", _
                               GetType(String), GetType(SampleViewModel), _
                               New PropertyMetadata(Nothing))

    End Class

A DependencyProperty can be easily added by using the `wpfdp` code snippet (type `wpfdp`, then press the `TAB` key twice), however, the code snippet is not type safe, and will not compile under `Option Strict On`.

**SampleWindow.xaml**

    <Window x:Class="SampleWindow"
            xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
            xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
            xmlns:des="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
            DataContext="{Binding}"
            Loaded="Window_Loaded">
        <Grid>
            <TextBox>
                <TextBox.Text>
                    <Binding Path="SampleString" />
                </TextBox.Text>
            </TextBox>
        </Grid>
    </Window>

**SampleWindow.xaml.vb**

    Class SampleWindow
    
        Private WithEvents myViewModel As New SampleViewModel()

        Private Sub Window_Loaded(sender As Object, e As RoutedEventArgs)
            Me.DataContext = myViewModel
        End Sub
    End Class

Note that this is a very rudimentary way to implement MVVM and databinding. A more robust practice would be to use a platform like Unity to "inject" the ViewModel into the View.
