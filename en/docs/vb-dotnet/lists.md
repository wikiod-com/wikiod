## Syntax
- List.Add(item As Type)
- List.RemoveRange(index As Integer, count As Integer)
- List.Remove(index As Integer)
- List.AddRange(collection)
- List.Find(match as Predicate(of String))
- List.Insert(index as Integer , item as Type)
- List.Contains(item as Type)

## Add items to a List
   


    Dim aList as New List(Of Integer)
    aList.Add(1)
    aList.Add(10)
    aList.Add(1001)

To add more than one item at a time use **AddRange**. Always adds to the end of the list

    Dim blist as New List(of Integer)
    blist.AddRange(alist) 


    Dim aList as New List(of String)
    alist.AddRange({"one", "two", "three"}) 

In order to add items to the middle of the list use **Insert** 

**Insert** will place the item at the index, and renumber the remaining items 

    Dim aList as New List(Of String)
    aList.Add("one")
    aList.Add("three")
    alist(0) = "one"
    alist(1) = "three"
    alist.Insert(1,"two")

New Output:

    alist(0) = "one"       
    alist(1) = "two"
    alist(2) = "three"

## Create a List
Lists can populated with any data type as necessary, with the format 

    Dim aList as New List(Of Type)
For example:

Create a new, empty list of Strings

    Dim aList As New List(Of String)

Create a new list of strings, and populate with some data

*VB.NET 2005/2008:*

    Dim aList as New List(Of String)(New String() {"one", "two", "three"})

*VB.NET 2010:*

    Dim aList as New List(Of String) From {"one", "two", "three"}

--

*VB.NET 2015:*
    
    Dim aList as New List(Of String)(New String() {"one", "two", "three"})


**NOTE:** 

If you are receiving the following when the code is ran:
> Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

Make sure you either declare as `New` i.e. `Dim aList as New List(Of String)` or if declaring without the `New`, make sure you set the list to a new list - `Dim aList as List(Of String) = New List(Of String)`

## Remove items from a List
    Dim aList As New List(Of String)
    aList.Add("Hello")
    aList.Add("Delete Me!")
    aList.Add("World")

    'Remove the item from the list at index 1
    aList.RemoveAt(1)

    'Remove a range of items from a list, starting at index 0, for a count of 1)
    'This will remove index 0, and 1!
    aList.RemoveRange(0, 1)

    'Clear the entire list
    alist.Clear()

## Retrieve items from a List
    Dim aList as New List(Of String)
    aList.Add("Hello, World")
    aList.Add("Test")

    Dim output As String = aList(0)

`output`:
> Hello, World

If you do not know the index of the item or only know part of the string then use the **Find** or **FindAll** method

    Dim aList as New List(Of String)
    aList.Add("Hello, World")
    aList.Add("Test")

    Dim output As String = aList.Find(Function(x) x.StartWith("Hello"))

`output`:
> Hello, World

The **FindAll** method returns a new List (of String)

    Dim aList as New List(Of String)
    aList.Add("Hello, Test")
    aList.Add("Hello, World")
    aList.Add("Test")

    Dim output As String = aList.FindAll(Function(x) x.Contains("Test"))
> output(0) = "Hello, Test"

>output(1) = "Test"


## Loop trough items in list
    Dim aList as New List(Of String)
    aList.Add("one")
    aList.Add("two")
    aList.Add("three")
    
    For Each str As String in aList
        System.Console.WriteLine(str)
    Next

Produces the following output:

    one
    two
    three


Another option, would be to loop through using the index of each element:

    Dim aList as New List(Of String)
    aList.Add("one")
    aList.Add("two")
    aList.Add("three")

    For i = 0 to aList.Count - 1 'We use "- 1" because a list uses 0 based indexing.
        System.Console.WriteLine(aList(i))
    Next

## Check if item exists in a List
        Sub Main()
            Dim People = New List(Of String)({"Bob Barker", "Ricky Bobby", "Jeff Bridges"})
            Console.WriteLine(People.Contains("Rick James"))
            Console.WriteLine(People.Contains("Ricky Bobby"))
            Console.WriteLine(People.Contains("Barker"))
            Console.Read 
        End Sub

Produces the following output:

    False
    True
    False
