## Using the default Form instance
VB.NET offers default Form instances. The developer does not need to create the instance as it is created behind the scenes. However, *it is **not** preferable* to use the default instance all but the simplest programs.

    Public Class Form1
    
        Public Sub Foo()
            MessageBox.Show("Bar")
        End Sub
    
    End Class
    
    Module Module1
    
        Public Sub Main()
            ' Default instance
            Form1.Foo()
            ' New instance
            Dim myForm1 As Form1 = New Form1()
            myForm1.Foo()

        End Sub
    
    End Module

## Passing Data From One Form To Another
Sometimes you might want to pass information that has been generated in one form, to another form for additional use. This is useful for forms that display a search tool, or a settings page among many other uses.

Let's say you want to pass a `DataTable` between a form that is already open *(MainForm)* and a new form *(NewForm)*:

**In The MainForm:**

      Private Sub Open_New_Form()
           Dim NewInstanceOfForm As New NewForm(DataTable1)
           NewInstanceOfForm.ShowDialog()
        End Sub

**In The NewForm**


    Public Class NewForm
        Dim NewDataTable as Datatable
       
        Public Sub New(PassedDataTable As Datatable)
           InitializeComponent()
           NewDataTable= PassedDataTable
        End Sub

    End Class

Now when the *NewForm* is opened, it is passed `DataTable1` from *MainForm* and stored as `NewDataTable` in *NewForm* for use by that form.

This can be extremely useful when trying to pass large amounts of information between forms, especially when combining all of the information in to a single `ArrayList` and passing the `ArrayList` to the new form.
