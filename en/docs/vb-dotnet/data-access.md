## Read field from Database
    Public Function GetUserFirstName(UserName As String) As String
        Dim Firstname As String = ""
        
        'Specify the SQL that you want to use including a Parameter
        Dim SQL As String = "select firstname from users where username=@UserName"
        
        'Provide a Data Source
        Dim DBDSN As String = "Data Source=server.address;Initial Catalog=DatabaseName;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=UserName;Password=UserPassword"

        Dim dbConn As New SqlConnection(DBDSN)

        Dim dbCommand As New SqlCommand(SQL, dbConn)

        'Provide one or more Parameters
        dbCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@UserName", UserName)

        'An optional Timeout
        dbCommand.CommandTimeout = 600

        Dim reader As SqlDataReader
        Dim previousConnectionState As ConnectionState = dbConn.State
        Try
            If dbConn.State = ConnectionState.Closed Then
                dbConn.Open()
            End If
            reader = dbCommand.ExecuteReader
            Using reader
                With reader
                    If .HasRows Then
                        'Read the 1st Record
                        reader.Read()
                        'Read required field/s
                        Firstname = .Item("FirstName").ToString
                    End If

                End With

            End Using

        Catch
            'Handle the error here
        Finally
            If previousConnectionState = ConnectionState.Closed Then
                dbConn.Close()
            End If
            dbConn.Dispose()
            dbCommand.Dispose()

        End Try
        'Pass the data back from the function
        Return Firstname

    End Function


Using the above function is simply:

       Dim UserFirstName as string=GetUserFirstName(UserName)


## Simple Function to read from Database and return as DataTable
This simple function will execute the specified Select SQL command and return the result as data set. 


    Public Function ReadFromDatabase(ByVal DBConnectionString As String, ByVal SQL As String) As DataTable
        Dim dtReturn As New DataTable
        Try
            'Open the connection using the connection string
            Using conn As New SqlClient.SqlConnection(DBConnectionString)
                conn.Open()
    
                Using cmd As New SqlClient.SqlCommand()
                    cmd.Connection = conn
                    cmd.CommandText = SQL
                    Dim da As New SqlClient.SqlDataAdapter(cmd)
                    da.Fill(dtReturn)
                End Using
            End Using
        Catch ex As Exception
            'Handle the exception
        End Try
    
    
        'Return the result data set
        Return dtReturn
    End Function

Now you can execute the above function from below codes

    Private Sub MainFunction()
        Dim dtCustomers As New DataTable
        Dim dtEmployees As New DataTable
        Dim dtSuppliers As New DataTable
    
    
        dtCustomers = ReadFromDatabase("Server=MYDEVPC\SQLEXPRESS;Database=MyDatabase;User Id=sa;Password=pwd22;", "Select * from [Customers]")
        dtEmployees = ReadFromDatabase("Server=MYDEVPC\SQLEXPRESS;Database=MyDatabase;User Id=sa;Password=pwd22;", "Select * from [Employees]")
        dtSuppliers = ReadFromDatabase("Server=MYDEVPC\SQLEXPRESS;Database=MyDatabase;User Id=sa;Password=pwd22;", "Select * from [Suppliers]")
    
    End Sub

The above example expects that your SQL Express instance "SQLEXPRESS" is currently installed on "MYDEVPC" and your database "MyDatabase" contains "Customers", "Suppliers" and "Employees" tables and the "sa" user password is "pwd22".  Please change these values as per your setup to get the desired results.

## Get Scalar Data
This simple function can be used to get value from exactly one field one record query result

    Public Function getDataScalar(ssql As String)
        openConnection()

        Try
            Dim q As New MySqlCommand

            q.Connection = db
            q.CommandText = ssql
            getDataScalar = q.ExecuteScalar

        Catch ex As Exception
            'Exception
        End Try
    End Function

How to use it:

    Dim userid as String = getDataScalar("select username from user where userid=99")

Variable 'username' would be filled with the value of field username as a result from that query.
