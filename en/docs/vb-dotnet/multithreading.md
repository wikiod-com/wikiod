## Multithreading using Thread Class
This example uses the `Thread` Class, but multithreaded applications can also be made using `BackgroundWorker`. The `AddNumber`, `SubstractNumber`, and `DivideNumber` functions will be executed by separate threads:

Edit: Now the UI thread waits for the child threads to finish and shows the result. 

    Module Module1
        'Declare the Thread and assign a sub to that
        Dim AddThread As New Threading.Thread(AddressOf AddNumber)
        Dim SubstractThread As New Threading.Thread(AddressOf SubstractNumber)
        Dim DivideThread As New Threading.Thread(AddressOf DivideNumber)
    
        'Declare the variable for holding the result 
        Dim addResult As Integer
        Dim SubStractResult As Integer
        Dim DivisionResult As Double
    
        Dim bFinishAddition As Boolean = False
        Dim bFinishSubstration As Boolean = False
        Dim bFinishDivision As Boolean = False
    
        Dim bShownAdditionResult As Boolean = False
        Dim bShownDivisionResult As Boolean = False
        Dim bShownSubstractionResult As Boolean = False
    
        Sub Main()
    
            'Now start the trheads
            AddThread.Start()
            SubstractThread.Start()
            DivideThread.Start()
    
            'Wait and display the results in console
            Console.WriteLine("Waiting for threads to finish...")
            Console.WriteLine("")
    
            While bFinishAddition = False Or bFinishDivision = False Or bFinishSubstration = False
                Threading.Thread.Sleep(50)     'UI thread is sleeping
                If bFinishAddition And Not bShownAdditionResult Then
                    Console.WriteLine("Addition Result : " & addResult)
                    bShownAdditionResult = True
                End If
    
                If bFinishSubstration And Not bShownSubstractionResult Then
                    Console.WriteLine("Substraction Result : " & SubStractResult)
                    bShownSubstractionResult = True
                End If
    
                If bFinishDivision  And Not bShownDivisionResult Then
                    Console.WriteLine("Division Result : " & DivisionResult)
                    bShownDivisionResult = True
                End If
    
            End While
    
            Console.WriteLine("")
            Console.WriteLine("Finished all threads.")
            Console.ReadKey()
        End Sub
    
    
        Private Sub AddNumber()
            Dim n1 As Integer = 22
            Dim n2 As Integer = 11
    
            For i As Integer = 0 To 100
                addResult = addResult + (n1 + n2)
                Threading.Thread.Sleep(50)      'sleeping Add thread
