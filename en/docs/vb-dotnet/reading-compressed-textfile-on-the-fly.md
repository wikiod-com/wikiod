## Reading .gz textfile line after line
This class open a .gz file (usual format of compressed log files) and will return a line at each call of `.NextLine()`

There is no memory usage for temporary decompression, very useful for large file.

    Imports System.IO

    Class logread_gz

      Private ptr As FileStream
      Private UnGZPtr As Compression.GZipStream
      Private line_ptr As StreamReader
      Private spath As String 

      Sub New(full_filename As String)
        spath = full_filename
      End Sub   

      Sub Open()
         Me.ptr = File.OpenRead(spath)
         Me.UnGZPtr = New Compression.GZipStream(ptr, Compression.CompressionMode.Decompress)
         Me.line_ptr = New StreamReader(UnGZPtr)
      End Sub()

      Function NextLine() As String
        'will return Nothing if EOF
        Return Me.line_ptr.ReadLine()
      End Function

      Sub Close()
        Me.line_ptr.Close()
        Me.line_ptr.Dispose()
        Me.UnGZPtr.Close()
        Me.UnGZPtr.Dispose()
        Me.ptr.Close()
        Me.ptr.Dispose()
      End Sub

    End Class

Note : there is no failsafe, for readbility purpose.
