This is the simplest yet descriptive example for the unit testing procedure. Feel free to add more methods to check against different data types.

## Unit Testing for Tax Calculation
This example is divided into two pillars

 - **SalaryCalculation Class** : Calculating the net salary after tax deduction
 - **SalaryCalculationTests Class** : For testing the method that calculates the net salary

**Step 1:** Create Class Library, name it **WagesLibrary** or any appropriate name. Then rename the class to **SalaryCalculation** 

''' <summary>
''' Class for Salary Calculations
''' </summary>
Public Class SalaryCalculation

  

        ''' <summary>
        ''' Employee Salary
        ''' </summary>
        Public Shared Salary As Double
    
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Tax fraction (0-1)
        ''' </summary>
        Public Shared Tax As Double
    
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Function to calculate Net Salary
        ''' </summary>
        ''' <returns></returns>
        Public Shared Function CalculateNetSalary()
            Return Salary - Salary * Tax
        End Function
    End Class

**Step 2** : Create Unit Test Project. Add reference to the created class library and paste the below code

    Imports WagesLibrary 'Class library you want to test
    
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Test class for testing SalaryCalculation
    ''' </summary>
    <TestClass()> Public Class SalaryCalculationTests
    
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Test case for the method CalculateNetSalary
        ''' </summary>
        <TestMethod()> Public Sub CalculateNetSalaryTest()
            SalaryCalculation.Salary = 100
            SalaryCalculation.Tax = 0.1
            Assert.AreEqual(90.0, SalaryCalculation.CalculateNetSalary(), 0.1)
        End Sub
    End Class

```Assert.Equal``` checks the expected value against the actual calculated value. the value ```0.1``` is used to allow tolerance or variation between *expected* and *actual* result.

Step 3 : Run the test of the method to see result

## Testing Employee Class assigned and derived Properties
This example has more tests available in unit testing.

**Employee.vb** (Class Library)

    ''' <summary>
    ''' Employee Class
    ''' </summary>
    Public Class Employee
    
        ''' <summary>
        ''' First name of employee
        ''' </summary>
        Public Property FirstName As String = ""
    
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Last name of employee
        ''' </summary>
        Public Property LastName As String = ""
    
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Full name of employee
        ''' </summary>
        Public ReadOnly Property FullName As String = ""
    
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Employee's age
        ''' </summary>
        Public Property Age As Byte
    
        ''' <summary>
        ''' Instantiate new instance of employee
        ''' </summary>
        ''' <param name="firstName">Employee first name</param>
        ''' <param name="lastName">Employee last name</param>
        Public Sub New(firstName As String, lastName As String, dateofbirth As Date)
            Me.FirstName = firstName
            Me.LastName = lastName
            FullName = Me.FirstName + " " + Me.LastName
            Age = Convert.ToByte(Date.Now.Year - dateofbirth.Year)
        End Sub
    End Class


**EmployeeTest.vb** (Test Project)

    Imports HumanResources
    
    <TestClass()>
    Public Class EmployeeTests
        ReadOnly _person1 As New Employee("Waleed", "El-Badry", New DateTime(1980, 8, 22))
        ReadOnly _person2 As New Employee("Waleed", "El-Badry", New DateTime(1980, 8, 22))
    
        <TestMethod>
        Public Sub TestFirstName()
            Assert.AreEqual("Waleed", _person1.FirstName, "First Name Mismatch")
        End Sub
    
        <TestMethod>
        Public Sub TestLastName()
            Assert.AreNotEqual("", _person1.LastName, "No Last Name Inserted!")
        End Sub
    
        <TestMethod>
        Public Sub TestFullName()
            Assert.AreEqual("Waleed El-Badry", _person1.FullName, "Error in concatination of names")
        End Sub
    
        <TestMethod>
        Public Sub TestAge()
            Assert.Fail("Age is not even tested !") 'Force test to fail !
            Assert.AreEqual(Convert.ToByte(36), _person1.Age)
        End Sub
    
        <TestMethod>
        Public Sub TestObjectReference()
            Assert.AreSame(_person1.FullName, _person2.FullName, "Different objects with same data")
        End Sub
    End Class

**Result after running tests**
