A class groups different functions, methods, variables, and properties, which are called its members. A class encapsulates the members, which can be accessed by an instance of the class, called an object. Classes are extremely useful for the programmer, as they make the task convenient and fast, with characteristics such as modularity, re-usability, maintainability, and readability of the code.

Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming languages.  


## Abstract Classes 
If classes share common functionality you can group this in a base or abstract class.  Abstract classes can contain partial or no implementation at all and allow the derived type to override the base implementation.

Abstract classes within VisualBasic.NET must be declared as `MustInherit` and cannot be instantiated.

    Public MustInherit Class Vehicle
         Private Property _numberOfWheels As Integer
         Private Property _engineSize As Integer
    
         Public Sub New(engineSize As Integer, wheels As Integer)
             _numberOfWheels = wheels
             _engineSize = engineSize
         End Sub
    
         Public Function DisplayWheelCount() As Integer
             Return _numberOfWheels
         End Function
    End Class



A sub type can then `inherit` this abstract class as shown below:

    Public Class Car
        Inherits Vehicle
    End Class

Car will inherit all of the declared types within vehicle, but can only access them based upon the underlying access modifier.  

    Dim car As New Car()
    car.DisplayWheelCount()

In the above example a new Car instance is created.  The `DisplayWheelCount()` method is then invoked which will call the base class `Vehicles` implementation.

## Creating classes
Classes provide a way of creating your own types within the .NET framework.  Within a class definition you may include the following:

 - Fields 
 - Properties 
 - Methods 
 - Constructors 
 - Events

To declare a class you use the following syntax:

    Public Class Vehicle     
    End Class

Other .NET types can be encapsulated within the class and exposed accordingly, as shown below:

    Public Class Vehicle
         Private Property _numberOfWheels As Integer
         Private Property _engineSize As Integer

         Public Sub New(engineSize As Integer, wheels As Integer)
             _numberOfWheels = wheels
             _engineSize = engineSize
         End Sub

         Public Function DisplayWheelCount() As Integer
             Return _numberOfWheels
         End Function
    End Class
