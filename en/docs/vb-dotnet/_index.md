Visual Basic .NET is the official successor to Microsoft's original Visual Basic programming language. Visual Basic [.NET] appears to have similarities to Python with the lack of semicolons and brackets, but shares with C++ the basic structure of functions. Curly braces are absent in VB .NET, but instead are replaced with phrases like `End If`, `Next`, and `End Sub`.
