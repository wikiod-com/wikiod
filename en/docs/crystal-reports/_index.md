Crystal Reports is designed for presenting database information in the form of reports - visualized lists, summaries, or charts depicting data from tables in a useful RPT format.

Reports are drafted in the graphically-orientated Design view, representing form objects like text or shapes as individual objects. This allows information to be arranged into a more familiar format as opposed to reading directly from the datasource.

Crystal Reports boasts connectivity with SQL tables, Oracle, Access databases, and Excel spreadsheets. Crystal itself has become partially integrated with Visual Studio over time. Reports can be exported as PDFs or text documents.
