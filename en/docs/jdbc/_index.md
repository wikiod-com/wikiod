JDBC, or Java DataBase Connectivity, is the Java specification for connecting to (relational) databases. JDBC provides a common API in the form of a number of interfaces and exceptions, and expectations (or requirements) of drivers.

The JDBC specification consists of two parts:

1. A specification document, available from the [JSR-221 page][1]
2. The API and its documentation, included with the Java SE API (packages [`java.sql`][2] and [`javax.sql`][3])

Most relational databases, and some non-relational databases, provide a driver that implements the JDBC.
