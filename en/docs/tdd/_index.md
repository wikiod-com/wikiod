Test Driven Development (TDD) is the process of writing code by beginning with a Test. First write a test that expects a known result. Then write the code that satisfies that result. Continue in this fashion until all known results have been satisfied.

This section provides an overview of what tdd is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within tdd, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for tdd is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.
