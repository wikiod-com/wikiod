Actionscript formerly developed by Macromedia Inc., which now have been acquired by Adobe Systems Inc. is a powerful object-oriented programming language based on ECMAScript. Initially created with very limited set of navigation controls like play(), stop(), gotoAndPlay() etc., usually used for 2D vector based animation and required Actionscript Virtual Machine(AVM) like Flash Player for execution, have now evolved into a robost and flexible programming language ideal for rapid rich internet application development, capable of hardware accelerated rendering with Stage3D, targeting not only Flash Player, but also Adobe AIR based desktop and mobile platforms.
