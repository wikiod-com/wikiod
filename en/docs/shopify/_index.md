This section provides an overview of what shopify is, and why a developer might want to use it.

It should also mention any large subjects within shopify, and link out to the related topics.  Since the Documentation for shopify is new, you may need to create initial versions of those related topics.

# No Versions for Shopify

Shopify does not release version numbers nor change logs, due to security concerns. To keep up with the changes in Shopify, the best places to check would be:

- [Shopify Blog](https://www.shopify.com/blog/topics/announcements)
- [Shopify Forums](https://ecommerce.shopify.com/forums)
- [Shopify Open Source Projects](http://shopify.github.io/)
