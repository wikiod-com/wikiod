Apache Camel is a framework that primarily facilitates solving enterprise integration challenges. At its core it can be thought of as a routing engine engine builder. In essence it allows you to connect systems(endpoints) via routes. These routes accept messages which can be of any data type. 

The Apache Camel framework also contains a complete set of EIP(Enterprise integration patterns) such as splitter, aggregators, content based routing and so on. Since the framework can be deployed in various standalone in Java applications, in various application servers such as WildFly and Tomcat or on a fully fledged enterprise service bus it can be seen as a integration framework.

To get started with the framework you would need to add it to a project using one of the following methods:

 1. Maven
 2. Gradle
 3. Spring Boot
 4. Plain Old JAR library reference added to your project.
