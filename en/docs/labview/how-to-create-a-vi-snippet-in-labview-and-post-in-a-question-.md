## Create VI snippet from Block Diagram
VI snippets are like Screenshots of a Block Diagram, with one important difference. They can be opened in LabVIEW to reconstruct the orginal program. They are saved in the common `.PNG` format so they can be used like normal pictures e.g. in forums and on StackOverflow.

To create a VI snippet mark the important part of your Block Diagram and hit **"Edit â†’ Create VI Snippet from Selection"**. Then choose where you want to save it. The VI Snippet has a border and a icon to indicate that you can drag them into LabVIEW to add the code to your Block Diagram.

This is what a simple VI snippet looks like:
